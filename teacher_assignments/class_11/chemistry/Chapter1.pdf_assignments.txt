Here are 3 assignment questions based on the provided NCERT chapter content, designed for CBSE Class 11-12 students, testing understanding of unit conversions and basic problem-solving in physics:

1.  A scientist measures the length of a newly discovered artifact to be 285 cm. Later, they need to present this length in a report that requires the measurement to be expressed in inches. Given that 1 inch = 2.54 cm, calculate the length of the artifact in inches, showing your working clearly with units.

2.  Explain, using the concept of dimensional analysis, why it is crucial to handle units carefully in calculations. Illustrate your explanation with a hypothetical scenario where incorrect unit handling leads to a wrong conclusion.

3.  A chemical reaction requires 1 mole of water (Hâ‚‚O). You have a large container of water. If the reaction needs to run continuously for 2 full days, how many moles of water are required in total, expressed as moles per second? Show all conversion steps clearly.
