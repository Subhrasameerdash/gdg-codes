Here are 3 assignment questions based on the provided (albeit limited) NCERT chapter content, suitable for CBSE Class 11-12 students, focusing on key concepts from kinematics and motion:

1.  **A small insect is stuck on the edge of a spinning vinyl record. The record completes one revolution every 2 seconds. If the insect then moves inwards towards the center of the record at a constant radial speed while the record keeps spinning, describe how the insect's overall velocity (magnitude and direction) changes over time.** (This question tests understanding of circular motion, vector addition of velocities, and how radial and tangential components combine.)

2.  **Imagine a motorboat capable of a certain speed in still water, attempts to cross a wide river with a consistent current flowing perpendicularly to the boat's intended path. If the boat operator wants to reach a point directly across the river, explain the relationship between the boat's speed, the river's current, and the angle at which the boat must be steered. Derive an expression for the time taken to cross the river in this scenario.** (This question tests understanding of relative velocity, vector components, and problem-solving in two dimensions.)

3.  **A projectile is launched from the top of a cliff at an angle to the horizontal. Qualitatively describe how Galileo's observations about projectile motion (as mentioned in "Two New...") help us understand the projectile's range, maximum height, and time of flight. Specifically address how the horizontal and vertical components of the motion are treated independently, and how this simplifies the analysis. Assume negligible air resistance.** (This question assesses understanding of projectile motion principles, the superposition of horizontal and vertical motion, and connecting theoretical concepts to Galileo's historical contributions.)
