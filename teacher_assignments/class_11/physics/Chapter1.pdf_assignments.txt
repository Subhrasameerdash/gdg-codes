Here are 3 concise and original assignment questions based on the provided (limited) NCERT chapter content, suitable for CBSE class 11-12 students:

1.  A student measures the side of a cube with a measuring instrument and records it as 3.00 x 10<sup>-3</sup> m. If the mass of the cube is known to be 2 g, calculate the density of the cube, paying close attention to significant figures in your final answer. Explain the rule applied for retaining significant figures during your calculation.

2.  The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by KE = (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup>. Discuss the significance of this formula in relating mass (m) and velocity (v) to energy. Also, explain how this formula can be used to define the SI unit of energy.

3.  Explain how the rules for significant figures in addition and subtraction differ from the rules for significant figures in multiplication and division, with examples.
