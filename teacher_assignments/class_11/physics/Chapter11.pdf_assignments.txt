Here are 3 assignment questions designed for CBSE class 11-12 students, inspired by the provided NCERT chapter content summary, focusing on key concepts rather than direct content reproduction:

1.  Explain the relationship between internal energy change and heat transfer in a system undergoing an isothermal process. Support your explanation with a solved example relevant to the definition of calorie.

2.  Consider a hypothetical process where a system's internal energy increases. Discuss two distinct scenarios, one involving heat and the other not, that could lead to this increase. Explain how the "calorie" concept applies to each scenario.

3.  Using your understanding of the provided definitions and solved examples, critically evaluate the statement: "The value of a calorie is independent of the specific process by which it's measured." Justify your answer.
