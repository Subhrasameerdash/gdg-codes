Okay, based on a general understanding of the chapters typically covered in CBSE class 11-12 physics (Units & Measurement, Kinematics, Laws of Motion, Work Energy & Power, Gravitation), here are three assignment questions designed to test key concepts, but without directly copying from any provided text:

1.  **Conceptual Application (Laws of Motion & Work-Energy):** A block of mass 'm' is initially at rest on a rough inclined plane with an angle of inclination 'θ'. A force 'F', parallel to the incline, is applied upwards on the block. Describe the conditions under which the block will (a) remain at rest, (b) move up the incline with constant velocity, and (c) accelerate up the incline. For case (c), derive an expression for the work done by the applied force 'F' after the block has travelled a distance 'd' along the incline, considering the effects of friction.

2.  **Problem Solving (Kinematics & Gravitation):** A projectile is launched from the surface of a planet with a radius 'R' and mass 'M' with an initial velocity 'v' at an angle 'θ' with respect to the horizontal. Derive an expression for the maximum height reached by the projectile above the planet's surface, assuming negligible air resistance. Also, determine the minimum value of 'v' for which the projectile will escape the planet's gravitational field (escape velocity).

3.  **Error Analysis & Dimensional Analysis (Units & Measurement):** In an experiment to determine the Young's modulus (Y) of a wire, the following measurements were taken: length of the wire (L), diameter of the wire (d), applied force (F), and extension of the wire (ΔL). Given that Y = (FL)/(πr²ΔL) where r is radius, (a) calculate the percentage error in the measurement of Y if the percentage errors in L, d, F, and ΔL are 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% respectively. (b) Use dimensional analysis to verify the correctness of the formula for Young's modulus, showing all steps clearly.
