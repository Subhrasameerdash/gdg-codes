Okay, here are three original assignment questions based on the provided chapter content, designed to test understanding of key concepts and problem-solving skills:

1.  **Comparative Analysis:** C3 and C4 plants have evolved different strategies to fix carbon dioxide. Describe the key structural and biochemical differences between these two types of plants and explain how these adaptations allow C4 plants to thrive in hot, arid environments. Furthermore, discuss the potential advantages or disadvantages either plant would have in a moderate, well-watered environment.

2.  **Experimental Design & Interpretation:** A student is investigating the effect of different wavelengths of light on the rate of photosynthesis in a newly discovered aquatic plant. They expose the plant to red, green, and blue light, measuring oxygen production in each case. The student observes that red light yields the highest oxygen production, followed by blue light, while green light results in very little oxygen production. Explain these results in terms of pigment absorption spectra and propose further experiments the student could conduct to fully characterize the photosynthetic pigments present in this plant.

3.  **Problem Solving & Application:** A greenhouse farmer is struggling to maximize the yield of their tomato crop. They have optimized the light intensity and temperature within the greenhouse, but the plants still seem to be underperforming. Considering the various factors that influence the rate of photosynthesis, propose three specific strategies the farmer could implement to further enhance photosynthetic efficiency and increase tomato production, justifying each strategy with reference to the underlying principles of photosynthesis.
