Here are 3 concise, original assignment questions based on the provided "Body Fluids and Circulation" chapter content:

1.  Imagine a scenario where a patient's kidneys are failing, leading to a buildup of urea and other nitrogenous wastes in their blood. Explain how this condition (uremia) could impact the composition of their blood and lymph, and discuss potential consequences for oxygen transport and fluid balance within the body.

2.  Compare and contrast the roles of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets in maintaining homeostasis within the body. Include specific examples of how disruptions in the production or function of each of these formed elements could lead to disease or dysfunction.

3.  A mountain climber ascends to a very high altitude where the partial pressure of oxygen is significantly reduced. Explain the physiological adjustments that would occur in their circulatory system, focusing on changes in heart rate, breathing rate, and erythrocyte production, to compensate for the lower oxygen availability. Relate these changes to the concept of double circulation and its advantages.
