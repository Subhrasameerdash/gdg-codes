Here are 3 concise, original assignment questions based on the provided Biological Classification chapter content:

1.  The five-kingdom classification system, while a significant advancement, still presents certain challenges when applied to organisms like viruses and lichens. Explain why these entities are difficult to classify within this system and propose a potential alternative approach for categorizing them. Justify your reasoning.

2.  Contrast the cellular organization and modes of nutrition observed within the kingdoms of Monera, Protista, and Fungi. Discuss how these differences reflect the evolutionary adaptations of each kingdom to their respective environments.

3.  Imagine you are tasked with classifying a newly discovered single-celled organism. Describe the key characteristics you would investigate (morphological, physiological, and genetic) to determine its appropriate placement within the existing classification system. Explain how each characteristic would contribute to your decision-making process.
