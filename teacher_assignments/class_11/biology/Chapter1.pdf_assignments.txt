Here are 3 assignment questions based on the provided NCERT chapter content, designed to assess key concepts for CBSE class 11-12 students:

1.  Discuss how the concept of biodiversity necessitates a standardized system of nomenclature. Illustrate your answer with a specific example from the chapter, highlighting the advantages of using binomial nomenclature.

2.  Ernst Mayr's definition of a biological species is widely accepted. Explain Mayr's definition, and then elaborate on potential limitations or challenges in applying this definition to classify all living organisms.

3.  Considering the example of insects provided in the chapter, devise a dichotomous key that could be used to classify three hypothetical insect species based on three observable characteristics. Justify the choice of your characteristics in terms of their suitability for classification.Here are 5 original and meaningful questions based on the provided, albeit limited, NCERT chapter content, designed for CBSE Class 11-12 students:

1.  **Question 1:** The chapter mentions the vast variety within the living world. While "variety" is evident, what challenges does this sheer diversity pose to scientists attempting to classify and understand life on Earth? Discuss at least three specific challenges, and propose a strategy to mitigate one of them.

2.  **Question 2:** Ernst Mayr's definition of a biological species is hinted at. Considering the inherent limitations of defining life neatly, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of relying solely on reproductive isolation (as implied by Mayr's definition) to delineate species boundaries. Provide examples where this definition might be inadequate or misleading.

3.  **Question 3:** The example of *Mangifera indica* is given. Explain the significance of binomial nomenclature. Why is it universally accepted in scientific communities? Imagine you discover a new plant species. Describe the steps you would take to properly name and classify it, adhering to established conventions.

4.  **Question 4:** Insects are mentioned as a group sharing common features. Beyond observable physical features, what underlying biological and evolutionary factors might explain the success and widespread distribution of insects compared to other animal groups? Consider factors like their adaptability, reproductive strategies, and ecological roles.

5.  **Question 5:** Based on the limited information, consider the core idea of classification in the living world. Design a simple dichotomous key to classify common organisms (at least 4) found in a typical garden (e.g., a butterfly, a rose, a sparrow, an earthworm). Your key should use easily observable characteristics and lead to a correct identification of each organism. Explain why dichotomous keys are important tools in biological identification.
