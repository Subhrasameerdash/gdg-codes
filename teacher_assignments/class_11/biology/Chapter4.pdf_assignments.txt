Okay, here are 3 concise, original assignment questions for CBSE Class 11-12, based on the provided "Animal Kingdom" chapter content, designed to test understanding rather than direct recall:

1.  **Evolutionary Advantage of Body Cavities:** Explain why the evolution of a true coelom (body cavity) was a significant step in animal evolution. Discuss at least three specific advantages that coelomate animals have over acoelomate animals in terms of organ development, body movement, and overall complexity.

2.  **Symmetry and Lifestyle:** Correlate the type of symmetry (asymmetrical, radial, or bilateral) observed in different animal groups with their respective lifestyles. Provide specific examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate how symmetry contributes to an animal's ability to find food, avoid predators, and interact with its environment.

3.  **Beyond the Notochord:** The presence of a notochord is a defining characteristic of Chordates. While vertebrates have a vertebral column, other chordates retain the notochord throughout their life. Discuss the specific advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a notochord compared to developing a vertebral column. Use specific examples of chordates to support your answer.
