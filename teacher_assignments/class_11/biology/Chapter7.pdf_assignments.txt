Here are 3 concise, original assignment questions based on the provided NCERT chapter content, designed for CBSE class 11-12 students:

1.  The frog is a poikilotherm that exhibits both aestivation and hibernation. Explain why these adaptations are crucial for the frog's survival, focusing on the environmental conditions that trigger each state and the physiological changes that occur within the frog's body during these periods.

2.  Imagine you are a biologist comparing the organizational complexity of a single-celled organism (like Amoeba) to that of a frog. Describe, in detail, the levels of organization present in the frog that are absent in the Amoeba, and explain how this increased complexity allows for greater efficiency in performing life functions.

3.  The frog's excretory system includes kidneys and ureters. Describe the role of each component in removing nitrogenous wastes from the body. Furthermore, why is the frog described as ureotelic, and what advantage might this provide compared to other forms of nitrogenous waste excretion in different animal groups?
