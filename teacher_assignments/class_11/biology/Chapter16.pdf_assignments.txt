Here are 3 concise, original assignment questions based on the provided chapter content:

1.  **Comparative Analysis:** Contrast the advantages and disadvantages of ammonotelism, ureotelism, and uricotelism as strategies for nitrogenous waste excretion. Explain how an animal's habitat influences its choice of excretory method, providing specific examples.

2.  **Mechanism and Regulation:** Describe the three primary processes involved in urine formation within the nephron (glomerular filtration, reabsorption, and secretion). For each process, explain *where* it occurs within the nephron and give a specific example of a substance that is significantly reabsorbed or secreted, outlining the importance of its regulation in maintaining homeostasis.

3.  **Clinical Application:** A patient is diagnosed with a condition affecting the ability of the loop of Henle to establish a strong concentration gradient in the renal medulla. Predict the likely consequences for the patient's urine output (volume and concentration) and explain the physiological reasoning behind your prediction. Further, discuss the potential long-term health complications if this condition remains untreated.
