Here are three original assignment questions based on the Morphology of Flowering Plants chapter, designed for CBSE class 11-12 students:

1.  A farmer notices that a newly introduced crop has an unusual root system. Instead of a single, dominant root, it features a cluster of thin roots originating from the stem base. Furthermore, its leaves exhibit parallel venation. How would you classify this root system and leaf venation type? Explain the advantages and disadvantages of this type of root system in comparison to a taproot system, particularly in the context of soil erosion and water absorption.

2.  Imagine you are a botanist studying a new plant species. You observe that its flowers are arranged on a central axis where the youngest flowers are located at the apex. The flowers also exhibit a unique arrangement of petals in the bud, where one petal completely covers the others. Describe the type of inflorescence and aestivation shown by the plant. How would the flowering pattern and petal arrangement aid in pollinator attraction and reproductive success?

3.  Two plants, A and B, both have flowers with five petals and five sepals. In plant A, the petals are fused together, and the stamens are attached to the petals. In plant B, the petals are free, and the stamens are not attached to the petals. Both plants have a superior ovary with two fused carpels. Create floral formulas for plants A and B and explain the key differences in the floral structures represented by these formulas. Based on these floral characteristics, what are the plausible families that these plants might belong to?
