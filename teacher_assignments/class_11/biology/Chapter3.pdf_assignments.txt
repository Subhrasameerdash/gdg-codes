Okay, here are three concise, original assignment questions based on the provided NCERT "Plant Kingdom" chapter content, designed for CBSE class 11-12 students:

1.  **Evolutionary Advantage:** The evolution of vascular tissue and seeds marked significant steps in the adaptation of plants to terrestrial environments. Explain how these features contributed to the success of gymnosperms and angiosperms in a wider range of habitats compared to bryophytes and pteridophytes.

2.  **Alternation of Generations:** Compare and contrast the relative dominance of the gametophyte and sporophyte phases in bryophytes versus pteridophytes. Explain how this difference reflects the evolutionary pressures faced by each group.

3.  **Phylogenetic Classification:** Describe how a phylogenetic classification system differs from an artificial classification system when grouping plants. Give a hypothetical example of how these two systems might differently classify a plant with unusual leaf morphology. Explain why the phylogenetic approach is considered superior for understanding plant diversity.
