Okay, here are three concise, original assignment questions based on the provided content, suitable for CBSE Class 11-12 students:

1.  **Imagine a scenario where a person has a genetic defect that results in non-functional troponin in their skeletal muscles. Explain the likely consequences of this defect on muscle contraction and relaxation, and how it would impact the person's ability to move.** (This question tests understanding of the sliding filament theory and the roles of key proteins.)

2.  **Compare and contrast the structure and function of the axial and appendicular skeletons. How do their distinct roles contribute to overall body support, movement, and protection? Provide specific examples of bones from each skeletal division to illustrate your answer.** (This question assesses knowledge of the skeletal system and its organization.)

3.  **A scientist is studying two different types of muscle tissue under a microscope. Muscle Tissue A appears striated and exhibits involuntary contractions, while Muscle Tissue B is non-striated and also exhibits involuntary contractions. Identify the types of muscle tissue being studied and explain the structural and functional differences that account for their contrasting characteristics.** (This question requires differentiating between muscle tissue types and relating structure to function.)
