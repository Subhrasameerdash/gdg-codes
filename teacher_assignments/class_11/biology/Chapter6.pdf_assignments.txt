Okay, here are 3 concise, original assignment questions based on the provided content related to "Anatomy of Flowering Plants," designed to test key concepts and understanding for CBSE class 11-12 students:

1.  **Comparative Analysis:** Imagine you're designing a controlled experiment to determine how environmental stress (e.g., drought) affects the anatomy of both a monocot and dicot leaf. Predict three specific anatomical changes you would expect to observe in *each* leaf type as a result of the drought stress. Justify your predictions with reference to the structural differences between monocot and dicot leaves, and how those structures relate to water conservation.

2.  **Tissue System Interdependence:** The ground tissue system is often described as the "workhorse" of the plant. Explain how the functions of the ground tissue system (e.g., photosynthesis, storage) are intrinsically linked to the efficient operation of both the epidermal and vascular tissue systems. Provide specific examples for each linkage.

3.  **Evolutionary Significance:** The presence or absence of cambium within vascular bundles distinguishes between monocots and dicots. Discuss the evolutionary advantages and disadvantages of both "open" (dicot) and "closed" (monocot) vascular bundles. Consider factors such as adaptation to different environments, life span, and structural support.
