Okay, here are three assignment questions designed for CBSE Class 11-12 students based on the provided Mathematical Modelling context, aiming to assess understanding of key concepts:

1.  **Scenario:** A small town is experiencing a rapid increase in its population. Initially, the population was 5,000, and after 5 years, it grew to 7,000. Assuming the population growth can be modeled exponentially, formulate a mathematical model to predict the population after 10 years. What assumptions did you make in formulating this model, and what real-world factors might limit its accuracy?

2.  **Design Challenge:** An architect is designing a rectangular window for a building. The window's perimeter must be 12 meters. Construct a mathematical model to determine the dimensions of the window that will maximize the amount of sunlight entering the building (i.e., maximize the area). Discuss the validity of your model, considering factors like the angle of the sun and the window's orientation.

3.  **Resource Optimization:** A factory produces two types of products, A and B. Producing one unit of product A requires 2 hours of machine time and 4 hours of labor. Producing one unit of product B requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor. The factory has a maximum of 18 hours of machine time and 16 hours of labor available per day. Formulate a mathematical model to determine the number of units of product A and product B that should be produced to maximize the total number of products manufactured. What are the limitations of this model in a real-world manufacturing setting?
