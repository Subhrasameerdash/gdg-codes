                === Focused Questions (5 marks each) ===
                1.  **Question 1:** Flowers are modified shoots adapted for sexual reproduction. Elaborate on this statement by explaining the roles of different floral whorls (calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium) in ensuring successful pollination and fertilization. Further, explain how double fertilization is the process, and the significance of its products.
2.  **Question 2:** The size of the Amorphophallus flower is striking. How might this extreme size be an evolutionary advantage for this plant? Discuss the potential selective pressures that could have led to the development of such a large inflorescence. In your response, consider the plant's pollination strategy and its environment.
3.  **Question 3:** Biotechnology offers solutions to several challenges faced by modern agriculture. Explain how the use of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) toxin in crop production reduces the reliance on chemical pesticides. Discuss the potential benefits and risks associated with using Bt crops.
4.  **Question 4:**  Differentiate between tissue culture and somatic hybridization. Explain the importance of each technique in crop improvement, providing at least one specific example of a commercially important plant developed using each method. Which of these methods will produce genetically modified plants?
5.  **Question 5:**  Gene therapy holds immense promise for treating genetic disorders. Describe the basic principles of gene therapy and the different approaches that can be used. What are some of the ethical considerations surrounding gene therapy, and how can these concerns be addressed?
6.  **Question 6:**  Explain the concept of biopiracy with a specific example. What are the ethical and economic implications of biopiracy, particularly for developing countries? Suggest measures that can be taken to prevent biopiracy and protect indigenous knowledge.
7.  **Question 7:** "Ecology is simply environmental science." Argue for or against this statement, clearly differentiating between ecology and environmental science in your reasoning. Discuss the importance of ecological principles in addressing current environmental challenges.
8.  **Question 8:**  Distinguish between exponential and logistic population growth. Explain the factors that lead to each type of growth pattern and their representation on a graph. Provide a real-world example of a population that might exhibit each type of growth.
9.  **Question 9:** The interactions between different species within a community can have significant impacts on population dynamics. Describe five different types of interspecific interactions (mutualism, competition, predation, parasitism, and commensalism) with a real-world example for each. Explain how these interactions contribute to the overall stability and diversity of the community.
10. **Question 10:** A population of deer is introduced to an island with abundant resources. Initially, the population grows rapidly. However, after a few years, the growth rate slows down and eventually stabilizes. Explain the factors that contribute to the change in the population growth rate of the deer, with specific reference to carrying capacity. How might climate change influence the carrying capacity of the island for the deer population?
