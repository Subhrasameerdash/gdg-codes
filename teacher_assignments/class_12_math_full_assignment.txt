                === Focused Questions (5 marks each) ===
                Okay, here are 10 focused assignment questions, each worth 5 marks, based on the provided NCERT content and suitable for Class 11-12 students.  These questions aim to test key concepts, reasoning, and application skills:

1.  **Relations:** Let R be a relation defined on the set A = {1, 2, 3} as R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)}. Determine whether the relation R is reflexive, symmetric, or transitive. Justify your answer with clear explanations for each property. Is it an equivalence relation? Explain.

2.  **Functions - Injectivity & Surjectivity:** Consider the function f: R → R defined by f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> + 2. Prove whether f is injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). Based on your findings, determine if the inverse of f exists. If it does, find the expression for f<sup>-1</sup>(x).

3.  **Inverse Trigonometric Functions - Principal Values:** Find the principal values of the following:  (a) sin<sup>-1</sup>(-√3/2)  (b) cos<sup>-1</sup>(-1/2)  (c) tan<sup>-1</sup>(-1). Explain why you chose those specific values, considering the principal value branches for each function.

4.  **Matrices - Operations & Properties:** Given matrices A = \[1 2] \[-1 3] and B = \[2 -1] \[0 1], verify that (AB)<sup>T</sup> = B<sup>T</sup>A<sup>T</sup>. Explain the properties of matrix transposition that make this identity hold true in general.

5.  **Determinants - Evaluating & Properties:** Evaluate the determinant of the matrix A = \[1 2 3] \[0 1 4] \[5 6 0]. Using properties of determinants, explain how the value of the determinant would change if you (a) swapped the first and third rows, and (b) multiplied the second row by a scalar 'k'.

6.  **Matrices - Invertibility:** Determine whether the matrix A = \[2 3] \[4 6] is invertible. If it is, find its inverse using the adjoint method. Explain why some square matrices do not have inverses, linking your answer to the determinant.

7.  **Continuity:** Examine the continuity of the function f(x) = {(x<sup>2</sup> - 4)/(x - 2), if x ≠ 2; 4, if x = 2} at x = 2. State the conditions for a function to be continuous at a point and show whether these conditions are satisfied for the given function.

8.  **Differentiability - Chain Rule & Implicit Differentiation:** Find dy/dx if y = sin(x<sup>2</sup> + 1). Also, if x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 25, find dy/dx using implicit differentiation. Explain the difference in the approaches used in both cases and why implicit differentiation is necessary for the second equation.

9.  **Applications of Derivatives - Increasing/Decreasing Functions:** Determine the intervals in which the function f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> - 3x<sup>2</sup> + 4 is increasing or decreasing. Show your working clearly. How does the sign of the first derivative relate to the increasing/decreasing nature of the function?

10. **Applications of Derivatives - Maxima & Minima:** Find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of the function f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> - 3x in the interval [-2, 3]. Explain the steps involved in finding absolute extrema, including identifying critical points and checking the endpoints of the interval.
