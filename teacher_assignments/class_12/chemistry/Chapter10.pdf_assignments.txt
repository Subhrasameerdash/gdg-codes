Okay, here are 3 assignment questions based on the provided NCERT chapter excerpt, designed to test understanding of biomolecules without directly copying the text:

1.  **The Protein Puzzle:** A research scientist discovers a novel protein with an unusual amino acid composition, notably lacking several common amino acids.
    (a) How might the absence of specific amino acids impact the protein's overall three-dimensional structure and function? Be specific about at least *two* types of interactions that could be affected.
    (b) If this protein is an enzyme, predict a possible consequence of the altered structure on its catalytic activity. Explain your reasoning.

2.  **Energy Needs and Molecular Choices:** An athlete is preparing for a marathon and needs to optimize their diet for sustained energy release.
    (a) Compare and contrast the roles of carbohydrates and lipids as energy sources for prolonged physical activity. Specifically, address the *rate* of energy release and the *storage capacity* of each biomolecule.
    (b) Describe how the athlete's body would utilize different types of carbohydrates (monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides) at different stages of the marathon (e.g., initial burst of energy vs. sustained endurance).

3.  **The Hormonal Cascade:** Explain how the properties of a hormone affect its mechanism of action within the body. Be sure to address:
    (a) Explain how fat-soluble and water-soluble hormones differ in their mode of action.
    (b) How the primary structure of a protein hormone, and its subsequent folding, affects its specificity for a target receptor. Explain the relationship between hormone-receptor binding and the downstream cellular effects.
