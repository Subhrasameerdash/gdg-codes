Okay, here are three assignment questions based on the provided chapter content on Solutions, designed for CBSE Class 11-12 students. The questions aim to test understanding of key concepts and encourage application of knowledge rather than direct recall:

1.  **Scenario-Based Application of Solubility:** A research lab is developing a new drug. Initial tests show the drug is most effective when delivered in an aqueous solution with a specific concentration. However, the drug is only sparingly soluble in water at room temperature. Propose and justify three different strategies (based on the principles discussed in the chapter) the researchers could use to increase the solubility of the drug in water to achieve the desired concentration. Explain the underlying principle behind each strategy.

2.  **Analyzing Non-Ideal Behavior:** Two liquids, A and B, when mixed, exhibit a significant negative deviation from Raoult's Law.
    *   Explain what this negative deviation implies about the intermolecular forces between A-A, B-B, and A-B molecules.
    *   Sketch a labeled vapor pressure vs. mole fraction diagram for this system, clearly showing the deviation from ideal behavior.
    *   Can this mixture form an azeotrope? If so, what type of azeotrope would it be, and what are the implications for separating A and B through distillation?

3.  **Colligative Property and Molar Mass Determination with Modification:** A student dissolves an unknown ionic compound, *XY<sub>2</sub>*, in water and observes a significant freezing point depression. The student calculates the molar mass of *XY<sub>2</sub>* using the freezing point depression formula, but the result is significantly lower than the actual molar mass. Explain why the calculated molar mass is incorrect, and describe how the Van't Hoff factor can be used to obtain a more accurate determination of the molar mass. Provide a step-by-step explanation of how to calculate the corrected molar mass if the experimental freezing point depression is Î”T<sub>f</sub>, the cryoscopic constant of water is K<sub>f</sub>, and the mass of the ionic compound is *m* grams dissolved in *V* mL of water (assume the density of water is 1 g/mL).
