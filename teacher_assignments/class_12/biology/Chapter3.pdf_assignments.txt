Here are 3 concise, original assignment questions based on the provided NCERT chapter content on Reproductive Health:

1.  **Debate the Socioeconomic Impact:** Many argue that access to reproductive healthcare, including contraception and safe abortion services, is crucial for a nation's economic development. Critically evaluate this statement, considering both potential benefits (e.g., reduced poverty, increased female workforce participation) and potential challenges (e.g., ethical concerns, resource allocation). Support your arguments with relevant examples.

2.  **Ethical Dilemma in ART:** A couple undergoing In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) has several viable embryos. They decide to select the embryo that is most likely to be free from a specific genetic disorder. Discuss the ethical considerations surrounding preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and embryo selection in the context of ART. Should there be limitations on which traits can be selected for or against, and who should decide?

3.  **Designing a Public Health Campaign:** Imagine you are tasked with creating a public health campaign to reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among adolescents in your community. Outline the key messages, target audience, and communication strategies you would use. Explain why you chose those specific approaches, considering factors like cultural sensitivity, accessibility, and effectiveness.
