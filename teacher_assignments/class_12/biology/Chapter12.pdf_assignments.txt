Here are 3 concise and original assignment questions based on the provided chapter content, designed to test key concepts about ecosystems:

1.  Imagine a newly formed volcanic island. Describe the likely stages of ecological succession that would lead to the development of a stable ecosystem on this island. Be sure to explain the roles of both biotic and abiotic factors in this process.

2.  A local farmer decides to remove all decomposers (e.g., earthworms, fungi) from their agricultural field to prevent them from consuming crop residue. Explain the short-term and long-term consequences of this action on the field's nutrient cycle, soil health, and overall productivity.

3.  Construct a hypothetical food web consisting of at least 5 different organisms in a specific ecosystem (e.g., a pond, a forest, a desert). Depict the organisms and their feeding relationships. Then, explain how a significant decline in the population of one of the organisms in your food web could affect the stability and biodiversity of the entire ecosystem.
