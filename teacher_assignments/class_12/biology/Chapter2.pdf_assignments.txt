Okay, here are 3 original assignment questions designed for CBSE Class 11-12 based on the provided content, focusing on understanding and application rather than direct recall:

1.  A couple is having difficulty conceiving. After initial investigations, the male partner's sperm count is found to be within the normal range. However, a significant proportion of his sperm exhibit abnormal morphology (shape). Explain how abnormal sperm morphology could contribute to infertility, even with a normal sperm count. Discuss the specific stages of reproduction that might be affected.

2.  The menstrual cycle is often described as a cyclical preparation for pregnancy. However, pregnancy doesn't always occur. Describe the hormonal and physiological events that occur during the menstrual cycle, and explain what happens differently in each phase (menstrual, follicular, luteal) if fertilization *does* occur versus if it *does not* occur.

3.  Compare and contrast spermatogenesis and oogenesis, highlighting *three* key differences in the timing, location, and products of these processes. Explain how these differences are linked to the differing reproductive roles of males and females.
