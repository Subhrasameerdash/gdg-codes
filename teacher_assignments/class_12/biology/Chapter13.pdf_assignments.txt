Okay, here are three original assignment questions based on the provided NCERT chapter content, designed for CBSE class 11-12 students:

1.  **Comparative Analysis of Conservation Strategies:** Imagine a newly discovered species of orchid found only on a small, remote island facing deforestation. Propose *both* an *in-situ* and an *ex-situ* conservation strategy for this orchid. Critically evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in this specific scenario, considering factors like cost, feasibility, and long-term sustainability. Which strategy, or combination of strategies, would you recommend, and why?

2.  **Latitudinal Gradients and Human Impact:** The latitudinal gradient suggests that biodiversity is highest in the tropics. However, many tropical regions are experiencing rapid habitat loss and exploitation. Explain the potential long-term consequences of this loss of tropical biodiversity, considering not only the ecological impacts (e.g., ecosystem services, food webs) but also the potential socio-economic impacts on human populations dependent on these ecosystems.

3.  **Applying the Species-Area Relationship:** You are an ecologist studying the impact of habitat fragmentation on beetle diversity in a forest. Before fragmentation, the forest covered 1000 hectares and contained 80 beetle species. After significant logging, the forest is now fragmented into 5 patches, each approximately 20 hectares in size. Assuming a species-area relationship with a Z-value of 0.25, *estimate* the number of beetle species you would *expect* to find in *each* of the remaining forest patches. Discuss the limitations of using this model to predict species loss in a real-world scenario like this.
