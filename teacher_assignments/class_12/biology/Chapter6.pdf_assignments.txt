Here are 3 assignment questions, designed for CBSE class 11-12 students, based on the provided (limited) NCERT chapter content. These questions aim to test understanding of key concepts like homology, analogy, adaptive radiation, and species definition.

1.  Using the examples of whales, bats, and cheetahs, explain the concepts of homology OR analogy. How do these concepts support evolutionary relationships?

2.  Describe how the diverse Australian marsupial fauna provides a compelling example of adaptive radiation. What specific environmental pressures might have driven the evolution of distinct marsupial species in Australia?

3.  The provided text references a "definition of the term species." Critically evaluate the challenges in creating a universally applicable definition of a species, considering factors such as hybridization and asexual reproduction. How might different species concepts address these challenges?
