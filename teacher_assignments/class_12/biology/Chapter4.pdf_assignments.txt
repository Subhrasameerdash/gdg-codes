2.  Contrast incomplete dominance and co-dominance, providing specific examples. How does the concept of multiple alleles, as demonstrated in the ABO blood group system, further complicate phenotypic expression?

3.  Distinguish between polygenic inheritance and pleiotropy, using phenylketonuria and another example of your choice to illustrate your explanation. How can environmental factors influence the phenotypic expression of genes in both scenarios?
