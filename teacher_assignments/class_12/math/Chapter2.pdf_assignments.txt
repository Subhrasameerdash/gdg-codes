Here are 3 assignment questions based on the provided chapter summary of Inverse Trigonometric Functions:

1.  A student simplifies an expression to `cos(tan⁻¹(x))`. Determine a simplified algebraic expression equivalent to this trigonometric expression, clearly showing the steps involved in your derivation. What is the domain of the simplified expression?

2.  Explain why restricting the domain of trigonometric functions is necessary to define their inverse functions. Use the example of the cosine function and its inverse, `cos⁻¹(x)`, to illustrate your explanation, specifically addressing the concepts of one-to-one functions and range.

3.  Evaluate the expression: `sin⁻¹(sin(5π/6))`. Explain why the answer is not simply `5π/6` and determine the correct principal value.
