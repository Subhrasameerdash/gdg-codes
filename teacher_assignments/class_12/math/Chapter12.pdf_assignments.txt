Here are 3 assignment questions based on the provided Linear Programming chapter content, designed to test key concepts and understanding:

1.  A clothing manufacturer produces two types of shirts: formal and casual. Formal shirts require 2 hours of cutting and 6 hours of sewing, while casual shirts require 5 hours of cutting and 4 hours of sewing. The manufacturer has a maximum of 40 hours available for cutting and 60 hours for sewing. If the profit on a formal shirt is $8 and the profit on a casual shirt is $6, formulate the linear programming problem to determine the number of each type of shirt to produce to maximize profit. Clearly define the objective function and all constraints. (This tests formulation and understanding of real-world applications).

2.  Explain the significance of the feasible region in a linear programming problem. How does the nature of the feasible region (bounded vs. unbounded) influence the existence of an optimal solution? Provide an example of a scenario where an unbounded feasible region might not have a maximum value for the objective function. (This tests conceptual understanding and ability to apply knowledge).

3.  Consider the following constraints for a linear programming problem:  `x + y ≤ 5`, `2x + y ≤ 8`, `x ≥ 0`, `y ≥ 0`. Graphically determine the feasible region. Then, without being given an objective function, describe how you would find the *minimum* and *maximum* values of a generic objective function `Z = ax + by` within that feasible region, given different positive values for 'a' and 'b'. (This tests graphical solution skills and generalization of the corner point method).
