Here are 3 assignment questions based on the provided NCERT Chapter 9 content on Differential Equations, designed for CBSE Class 11-12 students:

1.  Consider a scenario where the rate of cooling of a body is proportional to the difference between its temperature and the surrounding temperature (Newton's Law of Cooling). Formulate a differential equation representing this situation. Then, suppose a cup of coffee initially at 90째C cools to 70째C in 5 minutes in a room at 20째C. Determine how long it will take for the coffee to cool down to 40째C.

2.  A curve is defined such that the length of the sub-tangent at any point on the curve is equal to the x-coordinate of that point. Determine the general equation of such a curve. Also, find the particular solution if the curve passes through the point (e, 1).

3.  A tank initially contains 100 liters of pure water. Brine (water with dissolved salt) containing 2 kg of salt per liter is pumped into the tank at a rate of 3 liters per minute. The well-mixed solution is then pumped out at the same rate. Formulate a differential equation that models the amount of salt in the tank at any time *t*. Without solving the differential equation, explain what happens to the amount of salt in the tank as *t* approaches infinity.
