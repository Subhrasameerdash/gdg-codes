Here are three assignment questions based on the provided Three-Dimensional Geometry chapter content, designed for CBSE class 11-12 students:

1.  **Spatial Reasoning and Line Equations:** Imagine a straight tunnel is being bored through a mountain. The entrance is located at point A (1, -2, 0) and the tunnel needs to exit at point B such that the angle between the tunnel's path and the positive z-axis is 60 degrees. If the direction ratios of the tunnel are known to be proportional to (2, y, z), determine a possible location for point B and derive the Cartesian equation representing the tunnel's path. Discuss whether the location of point B is unique, and if not, provide two more possible locations.
2.  **Skew Lines and Shortest Distance - Real-World Application:** Two pipelines need to be laid in 3D space. Due to geological constraints, they cannot intersect. The first pipeline (L1) is described by the vector equation **r** = (i + j + k) + λ(2i - j + k), and the second pipeline (L2) is described by **r** = (2i + j - k) + μ(i + 2j - k). As the project engineer, you need to determine the shortest possible connection between these two pipelines to minimise material costs. Calculate this shortest distance and explain the significance of this distance in the context of the pipeline project.
3.  **Direction Cosines, Ratios and Angle relationships:** A line makes an angle of 45 degrees with the x-axis and an angle of 60 degrees with the y-axis. Determine the possible angles that this line makes with the z-axis. Explain geometrically why there might be more than one possible angle. Further, determine a set of direction ratios for such a line and state whether it's possible to deduce the direction cosines without additional information. Justify your response.
