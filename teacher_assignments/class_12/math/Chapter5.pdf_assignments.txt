Here are 3 assignment questions based on the provided NCERT chapter summary, designed to test key concepts without directly copying the text:

1.  A function *f(x)* is defined as follows: *f(x) = x + a* for *x ≤ 1*, and *f(x) = bx + 3* for *x > 1*. Determine the relationship between constants *a* and *b* such that *f(x)* is continuous at *x = 1*. Explain your reasoning using the definition of continuity.

2.  Consider the function *g(x) = e^(sin(x))*

    a) Determine the function's domain and range.
    b) Is the function continuos for all x? Explain your resoning.

3.  The displacement, *s*, of a particle at time *t* is given by *s = t*<sup>3</sup> *+ 2t*<sup>2</sup> *– 5t*.
    a) Find the velocity of the particle at time t.
    b) Determine the acceleration of the particle at time t.
    c) Find the rate of change of acceleration with respect to time.
