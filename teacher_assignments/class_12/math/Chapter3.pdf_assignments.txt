Here are 3 assignment questions based on the provided chapter content on matrices:

1.  A clothing manufacturer produces three styles of shirts: A, B, and C. They use three different fabrics: cotton, polyester, and rayon. Shirt A requires 2 units of cotton, 1 unit of polyester, and 1 unit of rayon. Shirt B requires 3 units of cotton, 2 units of polyester, and no rayon. Shirt C requires 1 unit of cotton, 2 units of polyester, and 3 units of rayon. Represent the fabric requirements for each shirt style as a matrix. If the manufacturer has 240 units of cotton, 160 units of polyester, and 150 units of rayon available, can you determine a possible combination of shirt styles that would utilize all of the available fabric? (This tests understanding of matrix representation and relating it to a real-world problem).

2.  Given two matrices, A and B, where A is a 2x3 matrix and B is a 3x2 matrix.  Explain why both AB and BA are defined, but they cannot be equal unless specific conditions are met. Further, provide an example of such matrices A and B where AB and BA are both defined, but of different orders. Explain why the resulting matrices are of different orders. (This question assesses understanding of matrix multiplication and its properties.)

3.  A square matrix A satisfies the equation AÂ² - 5A + 7I = 0, where I is the identity matrix of the same order as A, and 0 is the null matrix. Prove that A is invertible, and find an expression for the inverse of A in terms of A and I. (This question probes deeper understanding of matrix algebra, invertibility, and how to manipulate matrix equations.)
