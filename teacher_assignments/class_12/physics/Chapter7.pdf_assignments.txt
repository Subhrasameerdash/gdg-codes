Okay, here are three concise, original assignment questions based on the provided AC circuit chapter content, designed for CBSE Class 11-12 level, aiming to test understanding beyond rote memorization:

1.  **A residential area experiences frequent voltage fluctuations. Explain how a step-down transformer at the local substation ensures a stable voltage supply to homes, elaborating on the transformer's working principle and the factors that determine the voltage transformation ratio.** (This question assesses understanding of transformers and their practical application in voltage regulation, requiring explanation of the underlying physics.)

2.  **Consider an LCR series circuit connected to an AC source. Describe the conditions under which the circuit will exhibit resonance. Explain how the sharpness of resonance is affected by the resistance in the circuit, and discuss the practical implications of sharp versus broad resonance in radio receiver design.** (This question probes the understanding of resonance, its dependence on circuit parameters, and its application in a real-world scenario, emphasizing the link between theory and practical design.)

3.  **A factory uses a large inductive motor, resulting in a low power factor for its AC circuit. Explain why a low power factor is undesirable for the electricity provider. Suggest and explain a method the factory could implement to improve its power factor, including the impact of this method on the current drawn from the supply.** (This question examines the concept of power factor, its economic implications, and a practical solution, requiring application of knowledge to solve a real-world problem.)
