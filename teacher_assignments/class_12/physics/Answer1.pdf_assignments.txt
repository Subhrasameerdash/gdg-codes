Okay, here are 3 original assignment questions designed for CBSE class 11-12 students, based on the provided NCERT chapter content. These questions aim to test understanding of concepts rather than just rote memorization.

1.  **Electrostatic Equilibrium and Forces:** Two small spheres of equal mass 'm' are suspended from a common point by strings of equal length 'l'. Each sphere carries a charge 'q'. Due to electrostatic repulsion, the spheres are separated by a distance 'x' (where x << l). Derive an expression for 'q' in terms of m, l, x, and fundamental constants. Also, discuss how the charge 'q' would change if the entire setup were immersed in a dielectric liquid with a dielectric constant 'K'.

2.  **Capacitor Networks and Energy Storage:** A network of capacitors consists of three capacitors with capacitances C1, C2, and C3. C1 and C2 are connected in series, and this series combination is connected in parallel with C3. If a battery of voltage V is connected across this network, determine the following: (a) The equivalent capacitance of the entire network. (b) The charge stored on each individual capacitor (C1, C2, and C3). (c) The total energy stored in the capacitor network. Explain how the charge distribution changes if a dielectric slab is introduced into C3.

3.  **Motion in Magnetic Field:** An alpha particle (charge +2e, mass 4u) is accelerated from rest through a potential difference of V volts. It then enters a uniform magnetic field B, perpendicular to its direction of motion. Describe the subsequent path of the alpha particle within the magnetic field. Derive an expression for the radius of curvature of its trajectory in terms of V, B, e, and u. How does the kinetic energy of the alpha particle change as it moves through the magnetic field? Explain your answer.
