Okay, here are three assignment questions based on the provided chapter content, designed to test understanding of key concepts without directly copying the text:

1.  A student is experimenting with a convex lens and a candle. They observe that when the candle is placed 30 cm from the lens, a sharp, inverted image is formed on a screen also 30 cm from the lens on the other side.
    *   (a) Determine the focal length of the convex lens.
    *   (b) If the student then moves the candle to a position 10 cm from the lens, describe the nature of the image formed (real/virtual, erect/inverted, magnified/diminished) and explain your reasoning using the lens formula.

2.  Explain how total internal reflection is used in optical fibers to transmit signals, and why optical fibers are preferred over traditional copper wires for long-distance communication. Discuss two practical applications of optical fibers beyond telecommunications.

3.  A physics enthusiast wants to build a simple telescope using two lenses. They have a lens with a long focal length (Lens A) and a lens with a short focal length (Lens B). Explain which lens should be used as the objective and which as the eyepiece, providing justification based on the principles of how a telescope creates magnified images. Also, illustrate with a ray diagram how a parallel beam of light from a distant object is focused by the telescope, showing the role of each lens.
