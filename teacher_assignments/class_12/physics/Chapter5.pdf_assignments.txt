Okay, here are three original assignment questions based on the provided chapter content for CBSE Class 11-12 Physics, designed to test conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills:

1.  **Material Response and Magnetic Fields:** Imagine a scenario where a small sphere made of a paramagnetic material is placed near a strong bar magnet. Describe, in detail, the sequence of events that occur at the atomic level within the sphere as it is brought closer to the magnet. Explain how this leads to the sphere being attracted to the magnet, referencing the relevant magnetic properties and concepts discussed in the chapter. Further, discuss how the magnitude of the attractive force would change if the paramagnetic sphere was replaced with a diamagnetic sphere of identical size.

2.  **Gauss's Law and Hypothetical Monopoles:** Gauss's law for magnetism implies the non-existence of magnetic monopoles. Explain how this law is derived from experimental observations. Then, hypothesize what modifications would be required to Maxwell's equations if magnetic monopoles were to be discovered. Specifically, discuss how Gauss's law for magnetism and Ampere's circuital law would need to be altered to accommodate the existence of these monopoles and their associated currents.

3.  **Solenoid and Magnetic Material Analysis:** A long solenoid with closely wound turns is filled with a core of unknown magnetic material. You are able to measure the magnetic field *B* inside the solenoid using a Hall probe. You also know the number of turns per unit length *n* of the solenoid and the current *I* flowing through it. Describe a step-by-step procedure to experimentally determine the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of the core material using only the measurable quantities *B*, *n*, and *I*. Explain the underlying physics principles behind each step of your procedure and derive the final expression for χ in terms of *B*, *n*, and *I*. Also, outline potential sources of error in this experiment and how they could be minimized.
