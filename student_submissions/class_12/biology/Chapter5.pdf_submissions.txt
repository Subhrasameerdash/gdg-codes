1.  Explain the significance of sequence variations in a gene, linking your explanation to the concepts of alleles and the potential functional consequences in an organism.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT content and focusing on clarity and conciseness:

**Answer:**

Sequence variations within a gene are incredibly significant because they are the foundation for the existence of **alleles**. Remember that alleles (as you learned in Chapter 4) are alternative forms of a gene. These different alleles arise due to slight variations in the DNA sequence of that gene.

These sequence variations, which can include insertions, deletions, or substitutions of nucleotide bases within the gene, can have several potential functional consequences:

*   **Altered Protein Structure:** Since genes code for proteins, a change in the DNA sequence can lead to a change in the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein. This altered protein structure can affect the protein's folding, stability, and its ability to interact with other molecules.

*   **Changes in Gene Expression:** Sequence variations in the regulatory regions of a gene (like promoters) can affect how much of the gene product (RNA or protein) is produced. Some variations might increase gene expression, while others might decrease it, leading to different levels of protein being produced.

*   **Loss of Function:** Some sequence variations can be so disruptive that they render the protein non-functional. For example, a large deletion or a premature stop codon might lead to a truncated, non-functional protein.

*   **New Functions:** In rare cases, a sequence variation can lead to a protein with a new or modified function. This is less common but can be a source of evolutionary novelty.

Ultimately, the functional consequences of sequence variations depend on the specific nature and location of the variation within the gene. Because of these variations, organisms show differences in their traits and characteristics, which are important for both evolution and adaptation to their environment. Even simple sequence changes can lead to dramatic phenotypic differences through their effects on gene expression or protein function.

2.  Describe the processes of transcription and translation, highlighting the specific roles of enzymes like ribozymes in each process.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:

**Answer:**

Transcription and translation are the two fundamental processes involved in gene expression, ultimately leading to the synthesis of proteins.

**Transcription:**

Transcription is the process of copying genetic information from a DNA template into a complementary RNA molecule. This RNA molecule is called messenger RNA (mRNA).  It takes place in the nucleus in eukaryotes and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes. The main steps involved are:

1.  **Initiation:** RNA polymerase binds to a specific region of the DNA called the promoter. This binding initiates the unwinding of the DNA double helix at that site.
2.  **Elongation:** RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand, reading the sequence and synthesizing the mRNA molecule by adding complementary RNA nucleotides (A, U, G, C). Remember that uracil (U) replaces thymine (T) in RNA.
3.  **Termination:**  Transcription continues until RNA polymerase reaches a termination sequence on the DNA.  At this point, RNA polymerase detaches from the DNA and the newly synthesized mRNA molecule is released.

**Role of Enzymes (including Ribozymes) in Transcription:**

*   **RNA Polymerase:** This is the key enzyme responsible for catalyzing the formation of the phosphodiester bonds between RNA nucleotides, essentially building the mRNA strand.  It also plays a role in unwinding the DNA and proofreading the newly synthesized RNA.
*   **Ribozymes:** While RNA polymerase is the primary enzyme, some RNA molecules themselves can act as enzymes, called ribozymes. While the provided material doesn't elaborate specifically on ribozymes' role *in transcription*, it's important to know they exist. Their role in transcription might be related to processing the newly created RNA transcript, though this is beyond the scope of the given content.

**Translation:**

Translation is the process of decoding the mRNA sequence to synthesize a polypeptide chain (protein). This process occurs on ribosomes in the cytoplasm.

1.  **Initiation:** The ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG), which codes for methionine. A specific initiator tRNA molecule, carrying methionine, also binds to the start codon.
2.  **Elongation:**  The ribosome moves along the mRNA, codon by codon. For each codon, a tRNA molecule with the complementary anticodon (carrying the corresponding amino acid) binds to the mRNA. The ribosome then catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acids.  The ribosome translocates to the next codon, and the process repeats.
3.  **Termination:** Translation continues until the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) on the mRNA. There are no tRNA molecules that recognize these codons. Instead, release factors bind to the ribosome, causing the polypeptide chain to be released and the ribosome to dissociate.

**Role of Enzymes (including Ribozymes) in Translation:**

*   **Peptidyl Transferase:** This enzymatic activity is a key component of the ribosome itself. Specifically, it is a ribozyme (an RNA molecule with enzymatic activity) that catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids during translation. This is a prime example of the central role of RNA in cellular processes.

In summary, transcription and translation are tightly regulated processes that ensure the correct genetic information is used to produce functional proteins. Enzymes, including critical ribozymes, play vital roles in both processes by catalyzing specific steps and ensuring accuracy.

3.  Imagine a DNA sequence. How would the insertion or deletion of a single nucleotide within a coding region during replication ultimately impact the protein produced and what is this type of mutation commonly referred to as?
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer, designed to be clear, concise, and suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student, addressing the provided question based on the (admittedly limited) NCERT extract:

**Answer:**

The insertion or deletion of a single nucleotide (or a small number of nucleotides that are not multiples of three) within the coding region of a gene during DNA replication has a dramatic impact on the protein produced. This type of mutation is commonly referred to as a **frameshift mutation**.

Here's why:

*   **The Genetic Code:** The genetic code is read in triplets, called codons. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid.

*   **Reading Frame:** The sequence of codons establishes a "reading frame." This reading frame dictates which sets of three nucleotides are grouped together to be translated into amino acids.

*   **Frameshift Effect:** When a single nucleotide is inserted or deleted, it shifts the entire reading frame downstream from the point of the insertion or deletion. This means that all the codons *after* the mutation will be misread.

*   **Altered Protein Sequence:** As a result of the shifted reading frame, the amino acid sequence of the protein will be completely different from the original sequence, starting from the point of the mutation. It's highly likely that a premature stop codon will be encountered, leading to a truncated (shortened) and non-functional protein.  Even if a stop codon isn't immediately encountered, the altered amino acid sequence will almost certainly render the protein unable to perform its intended function.

* **Example:**
    Consider the DNA sequence `AUG GGC AAU UUA`. This codes for Methionine - Glycine - Asparagine - Leucine. Now, imagine an insertion of a 'C' after the first codon: `AUG CGG CAA UUU A`. Now, the sequence reads Methionine - Arginine - Glutamine - Phenylalanine.
