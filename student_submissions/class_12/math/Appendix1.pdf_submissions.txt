1.  Given the statement "If a matrix A is invertible, then A is non-singular," explain why proving the contrapositive of this statement is a valid method to establish its truth. Illustrate with a brief example of a 2x2 matrix.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student based on the provided NCERT chapter content, explaining the validity of using the contrapositive to prove a statement and illustrating with a 2x2 matrix example:

**Answer:**

The statement "If a matrix A is invertible, then A is non-singular" is a conditional statement of the form "If P, then Q," where:

*   P: A is invertible
*   Q: A is non-singular

Proving the contrapositive is a valid method because a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the contrapositive is true, then the original statement is also true, and vice-versa. The contrapositive of the statement "If P, then Q" is "If not Q, then not P."

In our case, the contrapositive of the statement "If a matrix A is invertible, then A is non-singular" is:

**"If a matrix A is singular, then A is not invertible."**

So, instead of directly showing that every invertible matrix is non-singular, we can show that every singular matrix is *not* invertible.  This is often easier because singularity is directly related to the determinant.

**Why this works (Explanation):**

*   **Singular Matrix:** A matrix is singular if its determinant is zero.  A matrix is non-singular if its determinant is non-zero.
*   **Invertible Matrix:** A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero.
*   **The connection:** Therefore, if the determinant of A is zero (A is singular), then A cannot have an inverse (A is not invertible). Conversely, if A is not invertible, then its determinant must be zero, making it singular.

**Example (2x2 Matrix):**

Let's consider a 2x2 matrix A:

A =  | a  b |
     | c  d |

The determinant of A, denoted as det(A), is calculated as:  det(A) = ad - bc

1.  **Assume A is singular:** This means det(A) = ad - bc = 0.

2.  **Show A is not invertible:** If A were invertible, it would have an inverse matrix, A<sup>-1</sup>. The product of a matrix and its inverse is the identity matrix (I). However, if det(A) = 0, then no such inverse matrix A<sup>-1</sup> exists. This can be seen from the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:

    A<sup>-1</sup> = (1/det(A)) *  |  d  -b |
                         | -c   a |

    If det(A) = 0, then we are dividing by zero, which is undefined.  Therefore, if A is singular (det(A) = 0), then A is not invertible.

**Conclusion:**

By proving the contrapositive "If a matrix A is singular, then A is not invertible," we have logically demonstrated the truth of the original statement: "If a matrix A is invertible, then A is non-singular." This is a valid and often useful technique in mathematical proofs. The example helps to illustrate this by demonstrating how a singular matrix cannot have an inverse, thereby validating the contrapositive.

2.  Construct a counterexample to disprove the statement: "For all real numbers *x*, if *x* > 0, then *x²* > *x*." Explain why your example serves as a counterexample.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content.

**Answer:**

A counterexample is a specific example that demonstrates that a general statement is false.  To disprove the statement "For all real numbers *x*, if *x* > 0, then *x²* > *x*", we need to find a real number *x* that is greater than 0, but for which *x²* is *not* greater than *x*.

Consider the real number *x* = 0.5 (which is equal to 1/2).

*   *x* > 0:  0.5 is indeed greater than 0.

*   *x²* > *x*?:  Let's calculate *x²*:  (0.5)² = 0.25

Now, compare *x²* and *x*:  0.25 is *not* greater than 0.5. In fact, 0.25 is *less than* 0.5.

**Explanation:**

The statement claims that *for all* positive real numbers, squaring the number will always result in a larger number. Our counterexample, *x* = 0.5, demonstrates that this is not true.  When we square 0.5, we get 0.25, which is smaller than 0.5.  Therefore, *x* = 0.5 is a counterexample that disproves the given statement because it satisfies the condition *x* > 0 but fails to satisfy the condition *x²* > *x*. The original statement is therefore false. It only holds true for real numbers greater than 1.

3.  Describe the differences in methodology and purpose between a direct proof and proof by contradiction. Provide a hypothetical mathematical statement and outline how you would approach proving it using *both* methods.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for a CBSE class 11-12 student audience and drawing upon the provided NCERT chapter content.

**Answer:**

A direct proof and proof by contradiction are two fundamental techniques used to establish the validity of mathematical statements. While both aim to demonstrate the truth of a statement, they differ significantly in their methodology and underlying logic.

**Direct Proof:**

*   **Methodology:** A direct proof starts by assuming the hypothesis (the 'if' part of a statement) is true. It then uses a series of logical deductions, definitions, previously proven theorems (axioms), and established rules of inference to arrive directly at the conclusion (the 'then' part of the statement). It's a straightforward, step-by-step process.
*   **Purpose:** The purpose of a direct proof is to build a clear, explicit chain of reasoning that directly links the hypothesis to the conclusion. It aims to show *why* the conclusion necessarily follows from the hypothesis.
*   **Example from NCERT Content:** While the provided examples demonstrate various proofs, the "direct method" is explicitly mentioned. Example 6, the proof that `f(x) = 2x + 5` is one-one, likely follows a direct approach although the complete steps are not included.

**Proof by Contradiction:**

*   **Methodology:** A proof by contradiction (also known as *reductio ad absurdum*) begins by assuming the *negation* of the statement we want to prove is true. We then use logical deductions, axioms, and theorems to derive a contradiction – a statement that is inherently false (e.g., 1 = 0, or a statement that contradicts a known axiom or theorem). Since our initial assumption led to a contradiction, we conclude that the negation of the original statement must be false. Therefore, the original statement itself must be true.
*   **Purpose:** Proof by contradiction is useful when a direct proof is difficult or impossible to construct. It's often used to prove statements that assert the impossibility of something. It shows that *if* the statement were false, it would lead to an absurd result.
*   **Example from NCERT Content:** Example 5, showing that the set of all prime numbers is infinite, is a classic example of a proof by contradiction. Although the detailed steps are missing, this is a typical application.

**Hypothetical Mathematical Statement and Approaches:**

Let's consider the following statement:

"If *x* is an even integer, then *x*<sup>2</sup> is an even integer."

**Direct Proof:**

1.  **Assume the hypothesis:** Assume *x* is an even integer.
2.  **Definition of even integer:** By definition, an even integer can be written as *x* = 2*k*, where *k* is some integer.
3.  **Square x:**  *x*<sup>2</sup> = (2*k*)<sup>2</sup> = 4*k*<sup>2</sup>.
4.  **Rewrite:** *x*<sup>2</sup> = 2(2*k*<sup>2</sup>).
5.  **Conclusion:** Since 2*k*<sup>2</sup> is an integer (because *k* is an integer), *x*<sup>2</sup> is of the form 2 times an integer. Therefore, *x*<sup>2</sup> is an even integer.

**Proof by Contradiction:**

1.  **Assume the negation:** Assume the statement is false. That is, assume *x* is an even integer, *and x*<sup>2</sup> is *not* an even integer (i.e., *x*<sup>2</sup> is odd).
2.  **Definition of even integer:** Since *x* is even, *x* = 2*k* for some integer *k*.
3.  **Square x:** *x*<sup>2</sup> = (2*k*)<sup>2</sup> = 4*k*<sup>2</sup> = 2(2*k*<sup>2</sup>).
4.  **Deduction:** From the result we can see that *x*<sup>2</sup> is even.
5.  **Contradiction:** This contradicts our initial assumption that *x*<sup>2</sup> is *not* an even integer.
6.  **Conclusion:** Since our initial assumption led to a contradiction, the negation of the original statement must be false. Therefore, the original statement, "If *x* is an even integer, then *x*<sup>2</sup> is an even integer," is true.

In summary, direct proofs provide a clear path from hypothesis to conclusion, while proofs by contradiction demonstrate the truth of a statement by showing that its negation leads to an absurdity. Choosing the appropriate method depends on the specific statement being proven and the ease with which each method can be applied.
