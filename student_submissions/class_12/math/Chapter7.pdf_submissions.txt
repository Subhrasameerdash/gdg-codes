1.  **Conceptual Understanding:** Explain the fundamental difference between an indefinite integral and a definite integral. In what situations would you use one over the other? Provide a simple example to illustrate your explanation.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:

**Answer:**

The fundamental difference between indefinite and definite integrals lies in what they represent and the type of answer they produce.

*   **Indefinite Integral:** An indefinite integral represents the *family of all antiderivatives* of a given function.  In simpler terms, it's the reverse process of differentiation, and because the derivative of any constant is zero, we add a "+ C" (the constant of integration) to represent all possible antiderivatives.  The answer to an indefinite integral is a *function* (or a family of functions).

*   **Definite Integral:** A definite integral, on the other hand, represents the *area under a curve* of a given function between two specific limits (a lower limit and an upper limit) on the x-axis.  The answer to a definite integral is a *numerical value* representing this area.

**When to Use Which:**

*   **Indefinite Integrals:**  We use indefinite integrals when we want to find the general antiderivative of a function. This is useful when we need to solve differential equations or find a function given its rate of change.  Essentially, if you need a function as your answer, you'll use an indefinite integral.

*   **Definite Integrals:** We use definite integrals when we want to calculate the area under a curve between two specific points. This has applications in physics (e.g., calculating displacement from a velocity function), economics (e.g., calculating consumer surplus), and statistics (e.g., calculating probabilities). Essentially, if you need a numerical value representing an area or accumulated quantity, you'll use a definite integral.

**Simple Example:**

Let's consider the function  *f(x) = 2x*.

*   **Indefinite Integral:**

    ∫ 2x dx = x<sup>2</sup> + C

    This tells us that the antiderivative of 2x is x<sup>2</sup>, plus some constant.  We don't know the exact constant, so we leave it as "+ C".

*   **Definite Integral:** Let's say we want to find the area under the curve *f(x) = 2x* from x = 0 to x = 2.

    ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> 2x dx = [x<sup>2</sup>]<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>  = (2<sup>2</sup>) - (0<sup>2</sup>) = 4 - 0 = 4

    This tells us that the area under the curve *f(x) = 2x* between x = 0 and x = 2 is exactly 4 square units. The "+C" is not present in definite integrals, because it cancels out when evaluating the limits of integration.

2.  **Application of Techniques:** A student is struggling to evaluate the integral ∫x√(x+1) dx. Guide them through the process by explaining which integration technique (substitution, integration by parts, partial fractions) is most appropriate and provide the initial steps. You do not need to completely solve the integral.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student tackling the integral ∫x√(x+1) dx:

**Answer:**

Okay, let's break down how to approach the integral ∫x√(x+1) dx.

**1. Identifying the Best Technique**

*   **Substitution:** This technique is often effective when you have a function and its derivative (or something closely related to its derivative) within the integral.
*   **Integration by Parts:** This is useful when you have a product of two different types of functions (e.g., a polynomial and a trigonometric function, or a polynomial and a logarithmic function). It follows the formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du.
*   **Partial Fractions:** This is used for integrating rational functions (fractions where the numerator and denominator are polynomials).

In this case, **substitution** is the most appropriate technique. Here's why: the expression inside the square root, (x+1), is a good candidate for substitution because its derivative is simply 1, which is a constant and easily manageable.

**2. Initial Steps for Substitution**

a.  **Choose a Substitution:** Let's make the substitution:

    u = x + 1

b.  **Find the Derivative:** Now, find the derivative of *u* with respect to *x*:

    du/dx = 1  which means du = dx

c. **Express 'x' in terms of 'u'**:
From our substitution u = x+1, we can rearrange and say x = u-1

d.  **Rewrite the Integral:** Substitute *u* and *du* into the original integral. We replace (x+1) with u, x with (u-1) and dx with du.

    ∫x√(x+1) dx  becomes ∫(u-1)√u du

This new integral, ∫(u-1)√u du, is simpler to work with than the original. You can now expand it and integrate term by term. You would then substitute (x+1) back in for u, and you're good to go!

**Important Note:** If you decide to use integration by parts, you'll eventually reach a similar integral, and might end up with more complex integrations, hence it's less convenient. Partial fractions is irrelevant in this case.

3.  **Problem Solving:** Determine the area enclosed by the curve y = sin(x), the x-axis, and the lines x = 0 and x = π. Explain how the concept of definite integrals is used to calculate this area.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided chapter content:

**Answer:**

To determine the area enclosed by the curve y = sin(x), the x-axis, and the lines x = 0 and x = π, we use the concept of definite integrals.

**Understanding Definite Integrals and Area:**

A definite integral represents the signed area between a curve and the x-axis within specified limits of integration.  In this case, our curve is y = sin(x), and our limits are x = 0 and x = π.  Since sin(x) is positive in the interval [0, π], the definite integral will directly give us the area we're looking for.

**Setting up the Definite Integral:**

The area (A) is given by the definite integral:

A = ∫[from 0 to π] sin(x) dx

**Evaluating the Definite Integral:**

1.  **Find the antiderivative:** The antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x).

2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:**  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that to evaluate a definite integral, we find the antiderivative of the integrand and then evaluate it at the upper and lower limits of integration, subtracting the value at the lower limit from the value at the upper limit.

    Therefore:

    A = [-cos(x)] [from 0 to π]
    A = -cos(π) - (-cos(0))
    A = -(-1) - (-1)
    A = 1 + 1
    A = 2

**Conclusion:**

The area enclosed by the curve y = sin(x), the x-axis, and the lines x = 0 and x = π is 2 square units. We used the definite integral to calculate this area because the definite integral provides a way to precisely determine the area under a curve between specified boundaries. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links differentiation and integration, allowing us to find the area by finding an antiderivative and evaluating it at the limits of integration.
