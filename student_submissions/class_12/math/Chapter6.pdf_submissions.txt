**Answer:**

**Problem:** A spherical balloon is being inflated at a constant rate. At the moment when the radius of the balloon is 10 cm, the surface area is increasing at a rate of 20 cm²/s. Determine the rate at which the volume of the balloon is increasing at that same instant.

**Solution:**

This is a related rates problem. We need to find the relationship between the rates of change of the volume and surface area of a sphere.

1.  **Formulas:**

    *   Volume of a sphere:  `V = (4/3)πr³`
    *   Surface area of a sphere: `S = 4πr²`

2.  **Given Information:**

    *   `dr/dt `at the time when `r = 10 cm`, is what we need to find out.
    *   `dS/dt = 20 cm²/s` when `r = 10 cm`
    *   We want to find `dV/dt` when `r = 10 cm`

3.  **Differentiation:**

    *   Differentiate the volume equation with respect to time *t*:

        `dV/dt = (4/3)π * 3r² (dr/dt) = 4πr² (dr/dt)`

    *   Differentiate the surface area equation with respect to time *t*:

        `dS/dt = 4π * 2r (dr/dt) = 8πr (dr/dt)`

4.  **Solve for *dr/dt*:**

    *   We can use the given `dS/dt` to solve for `dr/dt` when `r = 10 cm`:

        `20 = 8π(10) (dr/dt)`

        `dr/dt = 20 / (80π) = 1 / (4π) cm/s`

5.  **Solve for *dV/dt*:**

    *   Now, substitute the value of `dr/dt` and `r = 10 cm` into the `dV/dt` equation:

        `dV/dt = 4π(10)² * (1 / (4π))`

        `dV/dt = 4π(100) * (1 / (4π))`

        `dV/dt = 100 cm³/s`

**Answer:**  The rate at which the volume of the balloon is increasing at that instant is 100 cm³/s.

**Explanation of Related Rates and Optimization Concepts:**

*   **Related Rates:**  This problem exemplifies related rates because it deals with how the rates of change of different variables (volume, surface area, radius) are related to each other through a common variable (time).  The key is to establish equations that connect the variables and then use implicit differentiation with respect to time to find the relationship between their rates of change.  We used the chain rule implicitly in differentiating `V` and `S` with respect to `t`.

*   **Optimization (Indirectly Related):** While this specific problem isn't a direct optimization problem (finding maximum or minimum values), the techniques used in related rates are often crucial in solving optimization problems. For instance, we might have been asked to find the rate of inflation needed to maximize the volume of the balloon at a specific surface area expansion rate. In that case, we would use the relationships we derived to express the volume in terms of a single variable and then find its maximum using differentiation (as covered in the chapter's sections on maxima and minima).

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Identify the variables and their relationships.
*   Differentiate implicitly with respect to time.
*   Use given information to solve for unknown rates.
*   Understand the underlying concepts of related rates and how they connect to optimization.

2.  **Increasing/Decreasing Functions and Intervals:** Analyze the function *f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 5*. Determine the intervals on the real number line where the function is strictly increasing and strictly decreasing. Justify your answer using the concept of the first derivative and its sign. How would your answer change if the function was *f(x) = |x³ - 6x² + 5|*?
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the increasing/decreasing nature of the function *f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 5*, and then discussing the effect of the absolute value.

**Answer:**

**Part 1: Analyzing  *f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 5***

To determine the intervals where the function *f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 5* is increasing or decreasing, we need to analyze the sign of its first derivative.

1.  **Find the first derivative:**

    *f'(x) = d/dx (x³ - 6x² + 5) = 3x² - 12x*

2.  **Find the critical points:**

    Critical points occur where *f'(x) = 0* or where *f'(x)* is undefined. In this case, *f'(x)* is a polynomial, so it is defined for all real numbers.  We set *f'(x) = 0* to find the critical points:

    *3x² - 12x = 0*
    *3x(x - 4) = 0*
    *x = 0* or *x = 4*

    So, the critical points are *x = 0* and *x = 4*. These points divide the real number line into three intervals:  (-∞, 0), (0, 4), and (4, ∞).

3.  **Determine the sign of *f'(x)* in each interval:**

    *   **Interval (-∞, 0):** Choose a test point, say *x = -1*.  Then *f'(-1) = 3(-1)² - 12(-1) = 3 + 12 = 15 > 0*.  Therefore, *f(x)* is increasing on the interval (-∞, 0).

    *   **Interval (0, 4):** Choose a test point, say *x = 2*.  Then *f'(2) = 3(2)² - 12(2) = 12 - 24 = -12 < 0*. Therefore, *f(x)* is decreasing on the interval (0, 4).

    *   **Interval (4, ∞):** Choose a test point, say *x = 5*.  Then *f'(5) = 3(5)² - 12(5) = 75 - 60 = 15 > 0*. Therefore, *f(x)* is increasing on the interval (4, ∞).

4.  **Conclusion:**

    *   *f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 5* is strictly increasing on the intervals (-∞, 0) and (4, ∞).
    *   *f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 5* is strictly decreasing on the interval (0, 4).

**Part 2: Analyzing *f(x) = |x³ - 6x² + 5|***

Now, consider the function *f(x) = |x³ - 6x² + 5|*.  The absolute value function takes any negative value of the original function and makes it positive.  This has a significant impact on where the function is increasing and decreasing.  Specifically, the absolute value function creates "cusps" or sharp corners at the points where the original function *x³ - 6x² + 5* crosses the x-axis (i.e., where *x³ - 6x² + 5 = 0*).  At these cusps, the function is not differentiable.

1.  **Consider the roots of *x³ - 6x² + 5 = 0***

    Finding the exact roots of this cubic equation is not trivial and might require numerical methods.  However, we know that the function has local max at x=0 and local min at x=4. f(0) = 5 and f(4) = -27. So, the function will cross the x axis between x=0 and x=4, and after x=4.

2.  **Impact on Increasing/Decreasing Intervals:**

    *   Where *x³ - 6x² + 5* is positive, *|x³ - 6x² + 5|* behaves exactly like *x³ - 6x² + 5*.
    *   Where *x³ - 6x² + 5* is negative, *|x³ - 6x² + 5|* reflects that portion of the graph across the x-axis.  This means that an interval where *x³ - 6x² + 5* was decreasing will now be increasing, and vice versa.

3.  **Let the roots be *a*, *b*, *c*, *a < b < c***:

     *   f(x) is increasing on (-∞, a)
     *   f(x) is decreasing on (a, 0)
     *   f(x) is increasing on (0, b)
     *   f(x) is decreasing on (b, 4)
     *   f(x) is increasing on (4, c)
     *   f(x) is decreasing on (c, ∞)

**Important Considerations:**

*   The points where *x³ - 6x² + 5 = 0*  are *critical points* for *|x³ - 6x² + 5|*, but the derivative does not exist at these points. We need to consider them when defining intervals of increasing and decreasing behavior.
*   A graph of *|x³ - 6x² + 5|* would clearly illustrate the cusps and the changes in increasing/decreasing behavior.

**In summary, taking the absolute value dramatically changes the intervals of increasing and decreasing behavior. It introduces points where the function is not differentiable, and it reflects portions of the original function across the x-axis, inverting their increasing or decreasing nature.**

Determine the dimensions of the field that will maximize the area enclosed. Justify your answer using derivatives to find the local maxima, and also explain why this local maxima is also the absolute maxima in this scenario.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student studying applications of derivatives.

**Answer:**

**Problem:** A farmer wants to enclose a rectangular field bordering a straight river. He has 1000 meters of fencing. He needs no fencing along the river. Determine the dimensions of the field that will maximize the area enclosed. Justify your answer using derivatives to find the local maxima, and also explain why this local maxima is also the absolute maxima in this scenario.

**Solution:**

1.  **Define Variables and Constraints:**

    *   Let `x` be the length of the sides of the rectangle perpendicular to the river.
    *   Let `y` be the length of the side parallel to the river.
    *   The total fencing used is given by the constraint:  `2x + y = 1000` (since one side *y* doesn't need fencing).
    *   We want to maximize the area, `A`, of the rectangle, which is given by: `A = x * y`.

2.  **Express Area in Terms of One Variable:**

    From the constraint `2x + y = 1000`, we can express `y` in terms of `x`:  `y = 1000 - 2x`.

    Substitute this expression for `y` into the area equation:

    `A(x) = x * (1000 - 2x) = 1000x - 2x^2`

3.  **Find the Critical Points (Local Maxima/Minima):**

    To find the critical points, we need to find where the first derivative of `A(x)` is equal to zero or undefined.

    *   Find the first derivative of `A(x)` with respect to `x`:

        `A'(x) = d/dx (1000x - 2x^2) = 1000 - 4x`

    *   Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for `x`:

        `1000 - 4x = 0`
        `4x = 1000`
        `x = 250`

4.  **Determine if the Critical Point is a Local Maximum:**

    We can use the second derivative test to determine if `x = 250` corresponds to a local maximum.

    *   Find the second derivative of `A(x)`:

        `A''(x) = d/dx (1000 - 4x) = -4`

    *   Evaluate the second derivative at `x = 250`:

        `A''(250) = -4`

    Since `A''(250) < 0`, the function `A(x)` has a local maximum at `x = 250`.

5.  **Find the Dimensions:**

    *   We found `x = 250`.  Now find `y`:

        `y = 1000 - 2x = 1000 - 2(250) = 1000 - 500 = 500`

    Therefore, the dimensions of the field that maximize the area are 250 meters (perpendicular to the river) by 500 meters (parallel to the river).

6.  **Calculate the Maximum Area:**

    `A = x * y = 250 * 500 = 125000` square meters.

7.  **Justification for Absolute Maximum:**

    *   **Domain:**  The length `x` cannot be negative, and it can't be greater than 500 (because 2x must be less than or equal to 1000).  So, the domain of `x` is `0 ≤ x ≤ 500`.
    *   **Endpoints:**  Consider the area at the endpoints of the domain:

        *   If `x = 0`, then `A = 0`.
        *   If `x = 500`, then `y = 0`, and `A = 0`.
    *   **Conclusion:**  Since the area is zero at both endpoints of the domain and the local maximum occurs within the domain, the local maximum *must* also be the absolute maximum.  The function A(x) is a downward-facing parabola. Thus, it has only one maxima which is the absolute maxima. Intuitively, since we've exhausted the possibilities and the endpoints give a smaller area (zero), the local maximum we found is indeed the largest possible area.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the field that maximize the enclosed area are 250 meters (perpendicular to the river) by 500 meters (parallel to the river). This will result in a maximum area of 125,000 square meters. This local maximum is also the absolute maximum because the area is zero at the endpoints of the possible range of side lengths, and the function A(x) has a single maximum point.
