1.  **Spatial Reasoning and Line Equations:** Imagine a straight tunnel is being bored through a mountain. The entrance is located at point A (1, -2, 0) and the tunnel needs to exit at point B such that the angle between the tunnel's path and the positive z-axis is 60 degrees. If the direction ratios of the tunnel are known to be proportional to (2, y, z), determine a possible location for point B and derive the Cartesian equation representing the tunnel's path. Discuss whether the location of point B is unique, and if not, provide two more possible locations.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the tunnel problem using concepts from 3D geometry:

**Answer:**

**1. Understanding the Problem:**

We're dealing with a straight line (the tunnel) in 3D space. We know one point on the line (the entrance A), the direction ratios of the line (proportional to (2, y, z)), and a constraint on the angle it makes with the z-axis (60 degrees). Our goal is to find a possible exit point B and the equation of the tunnel.

**2. Finding Direction Cosines:**

Let the direction ratios of the tunnel be *a* = 2, *b* = *y*, and *c* = *z*. Let the direction cosines be *l*, *m*, and *n*. We know that *l* = cos α, *m* = cos β, and *n* = cos γ, where α, β, and γ are the angles the line makes with the x, y, and z axes, respectively.  We are given that γ = 60°. Therefore, *n* = cos(60°) = 1/2.

We also know the relationship between direction ratios and direction cosines:

*l* = a/√(a² + b² + c²)
*m* = b/√(a² + b² + c²)
*n* = c/√(a² + b² + c²)

Substituting the known values:

1/2 = z/√(2² + y² + z²)
1/2 = z/√(4 + y² + z²)

Squaring both sides:

1/4 = z² / (4 + y² + z²)

Cross-multiplying:

4 + y² + z² = 4z²

Simplifying:

y² = 3z² - 4

**3. Finding a Possible Solution for y and z:**

We need to find values for *y* and *z* that satisfy the equation y² = 3z² - 4.  Let's try some values for *z* and see if we get a real solution for *y*:

*   If z = 2, then y² = 3(2)² - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8. So, y = ±√8 = ±2√2.

Let's choose y = 2√2 and z = 2. This gives us direction ratios (2, 2√2, 2), which are proportional to (1, √2, 1).

**4. Finding a Possible Location for Point B:**

Let the coordinates of point B be (x, y, z). Since we know point A (1, -2, 0) and the direction ratios (1, √2, 1), we can express the line AB in parametric form:

(x - 1) / 1 = (y + 2) / √2 = (z - 0) / 1 = t  (where *t* is a parameter)

So, x = t + 1, y = t√2 - 2, and z = t

To find a possible location for B, we simply choose a value for *t*.  Let's choose t = 1:

x = 1 + 1 = 2
y = (1)√2 - 2 = √2 - 2
z = 1

Therefore, a possible location for point B is (2, √2 - 2, 1).

**5. Cartesian Equation of the Tunnel:**

Using the direction ratios (1, √2, 1) and point A (1, -2, 0), the Cartesian equation of the tunnel is:

(x - 1) / 1 = (y + 2) / √2 = (z - 0) / 1

**(x - 1) / 1 = (y + 2) / √2 = z / 1**

**6. Non-Uniqueness of Point B:**

The location of point B is *not* unique.  The value of the parameter *t* determines how far along the line we move from point A.  Since we can choose any value for *t*, there are infinitely many possible locations for point B.

**7. Two More Possible Locations for Point B:**

*   **If t = 2:**
    *   x = 2 + 1 = 3
    *   y = 2√2 - 2
    *   z = 2
    *   B = (3, 2√2 - 2, 2)

*   **If t = -1:**
    *   x = -1 + 1 = 0
    *   y = -√2 - 2
    *   z = -1
    *   B = (0, -√2 - 2, -1)

**Conclusion:**

We have found a Cartesian equation for the tunnel and shown that there are infinitely many possible locations for the exit point B. The specific location depends on how far along the line (defined by the direction ratios and the angle with the z-axis) the tunnel extends. The key was to use the relationship between direction ratios, direction cosines, and the given angle to find possible values for the direction ratios and then to parameterize the line to find different points on it.

2.  **Skew Lines and Shortest Distance - Real-World Application:** Two pipelines need to be laid in 3D space. Due to geological constraints, they cannot intersect. The first pipeline (L1) is described by the vector equation **r** = (i + j + k) + λ(2i - j + k), and the second pipeline (L2) is described by **r** = (2i + j - k) + μ(i + 2j - k). As the project engineer, you need to determine the shortest possible connection between these two pipelines to minimise material costs. Calculate this shortest distance and explain the significance of this distance in the context of the pipeline project.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the pipeline problem with clarity and relevant explanations:

**Answer:**

**1. Understanding the Problem:**

We're given two pipelines, L1 and L2, represented by their vector equations. The pipelines are skew lines, meaning they are neither parallel nor intersecting. Our goal is to find the shortest distance between them, which represents the minimum length of any connection needed to join or bridge these pipelines. Minimizing this distance directly minimizes the amount of material required for the connecting structure, hence reducing costs.

**2. Formula for Shortest Distance Between Skew Lines:**

Given two skew lines:

*   L1: **r** = **a1** + λ**b1**
*   L2: **r** = **a2** + μ**b2**

The shortest distance (d) between them is given by the formula:

d = | ((**a2** - **a1**) . (**b1** x **b2**)) / |**b1** x **b2**| ) |

Where:

*   **.** represents the dot product.
*   **x** represents the cross product.
*   |  | represents the magnitude of the vector.

**3. Applying the Formula to the Pipeline Problem:**

From the given equations:

*   L1: **r** = (**i** + **j** + **k**) + λ(2**i** - **j** + **k**)  =>  **a1** = **i** + **j** + **k**,  **b1** = 2**i** - **j** + **k**
*   L2: **r** = (2**i** + **j** - **k**) + μ(**i** + 2**j** - **k**)  =>  **a2** = 2**i** + **j** - **k**,  **b2** = **i** + 2**j** - **k**

Now, we calculate each part of the formula:

*   **a2** - **a1** = (2**i** + **j** - **k**) - (**i** + **j** + **k**) = **i** - 2**k**

*   **b1** x **b2** = (2**i** - **j** + **k**) x (**i** + 2**j** - **k**)
    = **i**((-1)*(-1) - (1)*(2)) - **j**((2)*(-1) - (1)*(1)) + **k**((2)*(2) - (-1)*(1))
    = -**i** + 3**j** + 5**k**

*   |**b1** x **b2**| = sqrt((-1)^2 + (3)^2 + (5)^2) = sqrt(1 + 9 + 25) = sqrt(35)

*   (**a2** - **a1**) . (**b1** x **b2**) = (**i** - 2**k**) . (-**i** + 3**j** + 5**k**)
    = (1)*(-1) + (0)*(3) + (-2)*(5) = -1 - 10 = -11

*   d = | (-11) / sqrt(35) | = 11 / sqrt(35)

Therefore, the shortest distance between the two pipelines is 11/sqrt(35) units.  We can rationalize the denominator to get (11 * sqrt(35))/35 units.

**4. Significance in the Pipeline Project:**

The shortest distance, calculated as 11/sqrt(35) units, represents the absolute minimum length of any connecting pipeline or support structure needed between L1 and L2.  Here's why this is significant:

*   **Cost Minimization:**  Using the shortest distance directly reduces the amount of material needed (pipe, supports, welding material, etc.), leading to lower construction costs. Even a small reduction in length can translate to substantial savings, especially in large-scale projects.
*   **Structural Integrity:** A shorter connection is generally more structurally sound and easier to maintain. It's less susceptible to stress and environmental factors.
*   **Safety:** Minimizing the length of the connection also minimizes potential leak points or failure points in the pipeline system, enhancing safety.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Reduced material usage translates to a smaller environmental footprint during manufacturing, transportation, and installation.

In conclusion, accurately calculating the shortest distance between the skew pipelines is crucial for optimizing the project in terms of cost, structural integrity, safety, and environmental impact. As the project engineer, this calculation is vital for making informed decisions about the pipeline connection strategy.

3.  **Direction Cosines, Ratios and Angle relationships:** A line makes an angle of 45 degrees with the x-axis and an angle of 60 degrees with the y-axis. Determine the possible angles that this line makes with the z-axis. Explain geometrically why there might be more than one possible angle. Further, determine a set of direction ratios for such a line and state whether it's possible to deduce the direction cosines without additional information. Justify your response.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the assignment question thoroughly:

**Answer:**

Let the direction cosines of the line be *l*, *m*, and *n*, which are the cosines of the angles α, β, and γ that the line makes with the x, y, and z axes, respectively.

Given: α = 45° and β = 60°. Therefore, *l* = cos(45°) = 1/√2 and *m* = cos(60°) = 1/2.

We know that the sum of the squares of the direction cosines is equal to 1:

*l*<sup>2</sup> + *m*<sup>2</sup> + *n*<sup>2</sup> = 1

Substituting the given values:

(1/√2)<sup>2</sup> + (1/2)<sup>2</sup> + *n*<sup>2</sup> = 1

1/2 + 1/4 + *n*<sup>2</sup> = 1

*n*<sup>2</sup> = 1 - 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4

Therefore, *n* = ±√(1/4) = ±1/2

This means cos(γ) = ±1/2

So, γ = cos<sup>-1</sup>(1/2) or γ = cos<sup>-1</sup>(-1/2)

γ = 60° or γ = 120°

**Possible angles with the z-axis are 60° and 120°.**

**Geometrical Explanation for Multiple Angles:**

Imagine a cone with its vertex at the origin and its axis along the z-axis. The line in question is constrained to make a 45-degree angle with the x-axis and a 60-degree angle with the y-axis. This constraint essentially confines the line to lie on the intersection of two cones (or surfaces derived from the angle constraints).  Because of the symmetry in 3D space, there are two possible orientations for the line that satisfy these conditions. One orientation makes an acute angle (60°) with the positive z-axis, and the other makes an obtuse angle (120°) with it, forming a conical shape opening either upwards or downwards from the origin along the z-axis.

**Direction Ratios:**

Since we know the direction cosines are (1/√2, 1/2, ±1/2), we can determine a set of direction ratios. Direction ratios are any set of numbers proportional to the direction cosines. We can simply multiply the direction cosines by a common factor to obtain direction ratios. To eliminate the fractions, we can multiply by 2√2.

If *n* = 1/2, direction ratios are approximately (2, √2, √2) (multiplying direction cosines by 2√2)
If *n* = -1/2, direction ratios are approximately (2, √2, -√2)

A simpler set of direction ratios can be obtained by multiplying the direction cosines by 2. This gives us:

If *n* = 1/2, direction ratios are (√2, 1, 1)
If *n* = -1/2, direction ratios are (√2, 1, -1)

**Can we deduce direction cosines from direction ratios without additional information?**

No, we cannot *uniquely* deduce the direction cosines from just *a* set of direction ratios. While the direction ratios give the line's orientation, they are not unique. We can scale the direction ratios by any non-zero constant and still represent the same line's direction.

To obtain the direction cosines from direction ratios (let's say *a, b, c*), we would normalize the direction ratios:

*l* = a / √(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>)
*m* = b / √(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>)
*n* = c / √(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>)

However, notice that *n* can be positive or negative.

In our case, without knowing the angle with the z-axis, we can calculate two possible sets of direction cosines corresponding to γ = 60° and γ = 120°. The problem statement *requires* us to find the angle that the line makes with the Z-axis, as we have done, and there is no way to calculate that angle with the information as stated.
