1.  Consider a scenario where the rate of cooling of a body is proportional to the difference between its temperature and the surrounding temperature (Newton's Law of Cooling). Formulate a differential equation representing this situation. Then, suppose a cup of coffee initially at 90°C cools to 70°C in 5 minutes in a room at 20°C. Determine how long it will take for the coffee to cool down to 40°C.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the provided assignment question about Newton's Law of Cooling, based on the NCERT chapter content on differential equations.

**Answer:**

**Part 1: Formulating the Differential Equation**

Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate of change of the temperature of an object is proportional to the difference between its own temperature and the ambient temperature (i.e., the temperature of the surrounding environment).

Let:

*   `T(t)` be the temperature of the body (e.g., the coffee) at time `t`.
*   `Ts` be the surrounding temperature (assumed to be constant).
*   `k` be the constant of proportionality (cooling rate).

Then, the differential equation representing Newton's Law of Cooling is:

```
dT/dt = -k(T - Ts)
```

*Explanation:*

*   `dT/dt` represents the rate of change of the temperature of the body with respect to time.
*   `(T - Ts)` represents the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings.
*   `-k` is a negative constant because the temperature decreases as the body cools. The negative sign ensures that if `T > Ts`, then `dT/dt` is negative (temperature is decreasing).

**Part 2: Solving the Differential Equation and Applying Initial Conditions**

We need to solve this differential equation to find `T(t)`.  We can use separation of variables:

1.  **Separate Variables:**
    ```
    dT / (T - Ts) = -k dt
    ```

2.  **Integrate both sides:**
    ```
    ∫ dT / (T - Ts) = ∫ -k dt
    ln|T - Ts| = -kt + C
    ```
    where `C` is the constant of integration.

3.  **Solve for T:**
    ```
    |T - Ts| = e^(-kt + C)
    T - Ts = ± e^C * e^(-kt)
    T - Ts = A * e^(-kt)     (where A = ± e^C is another constant)
    T(t) = Ts + A * e^(-kt)
    ```

Now, we need to use the given information to find the constants `A` and `k`.

*   **Initial Condition 1:** At `t = 0`, `T = 90°C`.  Also, `Ts = 20°C`.
    ```
    90 = 20 + A * e^(0)
    90 = 20 + A
    A = 70
    ```
    So, our equation becomes:
    ```
    T(t) = 20 + 70 * e^(-kt)
    ```

*   **Initial Condition 2:** At `t = 5` minutes, `T = 70°C`.
    ```
    70 = 20 + 70 * e^(-5k)
    50 = 70 * e^(-5k)
    5/7 = e^(-5k)
    ln(5/7) = -5k
    k = -ln(5/7) / 5
    k ≈ 0.0673  (per minute)
    ```
    Now we have a complete equation
     ```
     T(t) = 20 + 70 * e^(-0.0673 * t)
     ```

**Part 3: Finding the Time to Cool to 40°C**

We want to find the time `t` when `T = 40°C`.

```
40 = 20 + 70 * e^(-0.0673 * t)
20 = 70 * e^(-0.0673 * t)
2/7 = e^(-0.0673 * t)
ln(2/7) = -0.0673 * t
t = ln(2/7) / -0.0673
t ≈ 18.27 minutes
```

**Answer:**

It will take approximately 18.27 minutes for the coffee to cool down to 40°C. The differential equation representing the situation is dT/dt = -k(T - Ts) and its solution is T(t) = Ts + A * e^(-kt).

**Important Considerations for the Student:**

*   **Units:**  Make sure to keep track of units (temperature in °C, time in minutes).
*   **Assumptions:** Newton's Law of Cooling assumes a constant surrounding temperature and uniform temperature distribution within the object.
*   **Logarithms:** Make sure you understand the properties of logarithms.
*   **Calculator:**  Use a calculator to evaluate the exponential and logarithmic functions.
*   **Explanation:** Always explain the steps and the reasoning behind them.

2.  A curve is defined such that the length of the sub-tangent at any point on the curve is equal to the x-coordinate of that point. Determine the general equation of such a curve. Also, find the particular solution if the curve passes through the point (e, 1).
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter summary and content, addressing the sub-tangent problem.

**Answer:**

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem states a geometric property of a curve: the length of the sub-tangent at any point is equal to the x-coordinate of that point. We need to translate this geometric property into a differential equation, solve it to find the general equation of the curve, and then use the given point (e, 1) to find the particular solution.

**Step 1: Formulating the Differential Equation**

*   **Recall the definition of Sub-tangent:** The sub-tangent at a point (x, y) on a curve is the segment of the x-axis between the x-coordinate of the point and the x-intercept of the tangent line at that point. The length of the sub-tangent is given by  `y / (dy/dx)`.

*   **Translating the problem:**  The problem states "the length of the sub-tangent at any point on the curve is equal to the x-coordinate of that point."  Therefore, we can write the differential equation as:

    `y / (dy/dx) = x`

**Step 2: Solving the Differential Equation**

1.  **Rearrange the equation:**

    `y = x (dy/dx)`

    `dy/dx = y/x`

2.  **Separate the variables:** This is a separable differential equation.

    `dy/y = dx/x`

3.  **Integrate both sides:**

    ∫ `(1/y) dy` = ∫ `(1/x) dx`

    `ln|y| = ln|x| + C`   (where C is the constant of integration)

4.  **Simplify (Remove Logarithm):**
    Take the exponential of both sides:

    `e^(ln|y|) = e^(ln|x| + C)`

    `|y| = e^(ln|x|) * e^C`

    `|y| = |x| * e^C`

    Since e^C is just another constant, let's replace it with 'k' (where k > 0):

    `y = kx` (General equation)

**Step 3: Finding the Particular Solution**

We are given that the curve passes through the point (e, 1).  Substitute x = e and y = 1 into the general solution to find the value of *k*:

`1 = k * e`

`k = 1/e`

**Step 4: Write the Particular Solution**

Substitute the value of *k* back into the general solution:

`y = (1/e) * x`

`y = x/e`

**Final Answer:**

*   The general equation of the curve is `y = kx` (where k is an arbitrary constant).
*   The particular solution of the curve passing through (e, 1) is `y = x/e`.

3.  A tank initially contains 100 liters of pure water. Brine (water with dissolved salt) containing 2 kg of salt per liter is pumped into the tank at a rate of 3 liters per minute. The well-mixed solution is then pumped out at the same rate. Formulate a differential equation that models the amount of salt in the tank at any time *t*. Without solving the differential equation, explain what happens to the amount of salt in the tank as *t* approaches infinity.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for CBSE Class 11-12 students, based on the provided NCERT content:

**Answer:**

**Formulating the Differential Equation:**

Let A(t) be the amount of salt (in kg) in the tank at time *t* (in minutes). We are given that the tank initially contains 100 liters of pure water, so A(0) = 0.

The rate of salt entering the tank is the concentration of salt in the incoming brine multiplied by the rate of inflow.  The brine contains 2 kg of salt per liter, and it's entering at a rate of 3 liters per minute.  Therefore, the rate of salt entering is:

Rate in = (2 kg/liter) * (3 liters/minute) = 6 kg/minute

The rate of salt leaving the tank is the concentration of salt in the tank multiplied by the rate of outflow. The concentration of salt in the tank is A(t) kg / 100 liters (since the volume of the solution in the tank remains constant at 100 liters because the inflow and outflow rates are equal). The solution is pumped out at a rate of 3 liters per minute. Therefore, the rate of salt leaving is:

Rate out = (A(t) kg / 100 liters) * (3 liters/minute) = (3A(t)/100) kg/minute

The rate of change of the amount of salt in the tank, dA/dt, is the difference between the rate of salt entering and the rate of salt leaving:

dA/dt = Rate in - Rate out

dA/dt = 6 - (3A(t)/100)

Thus, the differential equation that models the amount of salt in the tank at any time *t* is:

**dA/dt + (3/100)A = 6**

with the initial condition A(0) = 0.

**Behavior as t approaches infinity:**

As *t* approaches infinity, we expect the amount of salt in the tank to approach a steady-state value.  This means that dA/dt will approach 0.  Intuitively, the tank will become saturated with salt.  Mathematically, we can see this by setting dA/dt = 0 in the differential equation:

0 = 6 - (3A/100)

(3A/100) = 6

A = (6 * 100) / 3

A = 200

Therefore, as *t* approaches infinity, the amount of salt in the tank, A(t), will approach 200 kg.  This makes sense because the concentration of salt in the outflow will eventually match the concentration of salt in the inflow (2 kg/liter).  Since the tank holds 100 liters, the final amount of salt will be (2 kg/liter) * (100 liters) = 200 kg.
