1.  Imagine a hypothetical metal with a work function of 3.0 eV is illuminated by light of two different wavelengths: 400 nm and 600 nm. Determine which wavelength, if either, will result in photoelectric emission. For the wavelength that causes emission, calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons in electron volts (eV). Explain your reasoning.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer to the assignment question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:

**Answer:**

To determine whether photoelectric emission will occur, we need to compare the energy of the incident photons for each wavelength with the work function of the metal (3.0 eV). If the photon energy is greater than the work function, photoelectric emission will occur.

**Step 1: Calculate the energy of photons for each wavelength.**

We use the following formula to calculate the energy (E) of a photon:

E = hν = hc/λ

where:

*   h is Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 x 10<sup>-34</sup> J s or 4.135 x 10<sup>-15</sup> eV s)
*   c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s)
*   λ is the wavelength of the light

*   **For λ = 400 nm (400 x 10<sup>-9</sup> m):**

    E = (4.135 x 10<sup>-15</sup> eV s * 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s) / (400 x 10<sup>-9</sup> m)
    E ≈ 3.10 eV

*   **For λ = 600 nm (600 x 10<sup>-9</sup> m):**

    E = (4.135 x 10<sup>-15</sup> eV s * 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s) / (600 x 10<sup>-9</sup> m)
    E ≈ 2.07 eV

**Step 2: Compare the photon energies with the work function.**

*   **For λ = 400 nm:** The photon energy (3.10 eV) is greater than the work function (3.0 eV). Therefore, photoelectric emission *will* occur.

*   **For λ = 600 nm:** The photon energy (2.07 eV) is less than the work function (3.0 eV). Therefore, photoelectric emission *will not* occur.

**Step 3: Calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons for λ = 400 nm.**

We use Einstein's photoelectric equation:

KE<sub>max</sub> = hν - Φ₀

where:

*   KE<sub>max</sub> is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons
*   hν is the energy of the incident photon
*   Φ₀ is the work function of the metal

In this case:

KE<sub>max</sub> = 3.10 eV - 3.0 eV
KE<sub>max</sub> = 0.10 eV

**Conclusion:**

Only the light with a wavelength of 400 nm will cause photoelectric emission from the hypothetical metal. The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons when the metal is illuminated with 400 nm light is 0.10 eV.  The 600 nm light does not have enough energy per photon to overcome the work function of the metal and therefore cannot cause photoelectric emission.

2.  An electron and a proton are accelerated from rest through the same potential difference. Calculate the ratio of their de Broglie wavelengths. Explain how this ratio demonstrates the relationship between a particle's mass and its wave-like behavior.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided chapter content:

**Answer:**

To find the ratio of the de Broglie wavelengths of an electron and a proton accelerated through the same potential difference, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Kinetic Energy and Momentum:** When a charged particle (electron or proton) is accelerated through a potential difference *V*, it gains kinetic energy (KE) equal to *qV*, where *q* is the charge of the particle. Since both the electron and proton are accelerated through the *same* potential difference, *V*, and the magnitude of their charges is the same (*e*), their kinetic energies will be:

   KE<sub>electron</sub> = *eV*
   KE<sub>proton</sub> = *eV*

   The kinetic energy is also related to momentum (p) and mass (m) by the equation: KE = p<sup>2</sup> / 2m. Therefore, p = √(2mKE).  We can write the momentum of the electron and proton as:

   p<sub>electron</sub> = √(2m<sub>e</sub>KE<sub>electron</sub>) = √(2m<sub>e</sub>eV)
   p<sub>proton</sub> = √(2m<sub>p</sub>KE<sub>proton</sub>) = √(2m<sub>p</sub>eV)

   where m<sub>e</sub> is the mass of the electron and m<sub>p</sub> is the mass of the proton.

2. **De Broglie Wavelength:** The de Broglie wavelength (λ) is given by the formula λ = h/p, where h is Planck's constant. So,

   λ<sub>electron</sub> = h / p<sub>electron</sub> = h / √(2m<sub>e</sub>eV)
   λ<sub>proton</sub> = h / p<sub>proton</sub> = h / √(2m<sub>p</sub>eV)

3. **Ratio of Wavelengths:** Now, let's find the ratio of the de Broglie wavelengths:

   λ<sub>electron</sub> / λ<sub>proton</sub> =  [h / √(2m<sub>e</sub>eV)] / [h / √(2m<sub>p</sub>eV)]
   λ<sub>electron</sub> / λ<sub>proton</sub> = √(2m<sub>p</sub>eV) / √(2m<sub>e</sub>eV)

   Notice that *h*, *2*, *e*, and *V* cancel out, leaving us with:

   λ<sub>electron</sub> / λ<sub>proton</sub> = √(m<sub>p</sub> / m<sub>e</sub>)

4. **Calculation:**  We know that the mass of a proton (m<sub>p</sub>) is approximately 1836 times the mass of an electron (m<sub>e</sub>).

   λ<sub>electron</sub> / λ<sub>proton</sub> = √(1836 m<sub>e</sub> / m<sub>e</sub>) = √1836 ≈ 42.85

Therefore, the ratio of the de Broglie wavelength of the electron to that of the proton is approximately 42.85. This means the electron has a significantly larger de Broglie wavelength than the proton when accelerated through the same potential difference.

**Explanation of Mass and Wave-like Behavior:**

This result beautifully illustrates the inverse relationship between a particle's mass and its wave-like behavior, as described by de Broglie's hypothesis.  The de Broglie wavelength is *inversely proportional to the momentum* of the particle, and since momentum depends on mass, a lighter particle (like the electron) will have a larger de Broglie wavelength than a heavier particle (like the proton) when they have the same kinetic energy (gained from the same potential difference).

In simpler terms, for the same amount of "push" (kinetic energy), the smaller electron exhibits more pronounced wave-like characteristics (larger wavelength) compared to the more massive proton. This reinforces the concept that all matter possesses wave-like properties, but these properties are more easily observable for particles with smaller masses. It's harder to observe the wave nature of macroscopic objects because their much larger masses result in extremely small de Broglie wavelengths.

3.  Critically evaluate the statement: "The intensity of light is directly proportional to the kinetic energy of emitted photoelectrons in the photoelectric effect." Justify your answer using concepts from the chapter, including the roles of frequency, work function, and photons. Explain what *is* proportional to intensity.
Sample Answer:
The statement "The intensity of light is directly proportional to the kinetic energy of emitted photoelectrons in the photoelectric effect" is **incorrect**. This contradicts the fundamental principles of the photoelectric effect.

Here's a breakdown of why this statement is wrong and what the true relationships are:

**Why the statement is incorrect:**

*   **Einstein's Photoelectric Equation:** The kinetic energy (KE<sub>max</sub>) of emitted photoelectrons is determined by Einstein's photoelectric equation: KE<sub>max</sub> = hν - Φ₀.  Here, 'h' is Planck's constant, 'ν' (nu) is the frequency of the incident light, and 'Φ₀' is the work function of the metal.  This equation clearly shows that the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons depends *linearly* on the *frequency* of the light, **not** the intensity.

*   **Role of Frequency:** If the frequency (ν) of the incident light is below the threshold frequency (ν₀) for a particular metal, no photoelectrons will be emitted, regardless of how intense the light is. The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency needed to overcome the work function (ν₀ = Φ₀/h). Only light with a frequency greater than the threshold frequency can cause electron emission.

*   **Role of Work Function:** The work function (Φ₀) is a property of the metal and represents the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal's surface. A higher work function means the electrons are more tightly bound, and more energy (higher frequency light) is needed to eject them. It is a constant for a given metal.

*   **Photons as Energy Packets:** Light is composed of discrete packets of energy called photons. Each photon has an energy E = hν. In the photoelectric effect, one photon interacts with one electron. The photon transfers its energy to the electron. If the photon's energy (hν) is greater than the work function (Φ₀), the electron is emitted with a kinetic energy equal to the difference (KE<sub>max</sub> = hν - Φ₀).

*   **Intensity and Number of Photons:** Intensity is the power per unit area of the light beam. Higher intensity means more photons are striking the metal surface per unit time. While intensity doesn't affect the *kinetic energy* of individual photoelectrons, it *does* affect the *number* of photoelectrons emitted.

**What *is* proportional to intensity:**

*   **Number of Photoelectrons Emitted (Photoelectric Current):** The *intensity of light is directly proportional to the number of photoelectrons emitted per unit time*, which constitutes the photoelectric current. If you increase the intensity of the light (while keeping the frequency above the threshold frequency), you increase the number of photons hitting the surface, which in turn ejects more electrons.  This results in a higher photoelectric current.

**In summary:**

The kinetic energy of emitted photoelectrons is determined by the frequency of the incident light and the work function of the metal, as described by Einstein's photoelectric equation. The intensity of the light determines the number of photoelectrons emitted, thus influencing the magnitude of the photoelectric current.
