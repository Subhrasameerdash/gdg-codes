1.  The modern definition of the Ampere aims to eliminate effects. Explain why a purely theoretical definition proved insufficient, and what real-world considerations necessitate this effort to eliminate effects in defining the standard unit of current.
Sample Answer:
The modern definition of the Ampere aims to eliminate the effects of certain variables because a purely theoretical definition proved insufficient for practical applications. Here's why:

*   **Theoretical Definition Limitations:** A purely theoretical definition of the ampere, while mathematically elegant, relies on idealized conditions that cannot be perfectly replicated in the real world. For instance, such a definition might assume perfectly uniform magnetic fields, perfectly parallel wires, and a perfect vacuum, none of which exist practically.

*   **Real-World Impurities and Effects:** In real-world experiments, various factors can influence the force between current-carrying wires, which forms the basis of the Ampere's definition. These factors include:
    *   **Edge effects:** The non-infinite length of the wires used in experiments introduces edge effects that deviate from the ideal theoretical model.
    *   **Temperature:** Changes in temperature affect the conductivity and dimensions of the wires, altering the current flow and thus the measured force.
    *   **Magnetic properties of surroundings:** The presence of ferromagnetic materials near the wires can distort the magnetic field and influence the measured force.
    *   **Non-ideal vacuum:** The presence of even trace amounts of gas molecules can affect the force measurement.

*   **Need for Precision and Reproducibility:** For scientific and technological applications, it's crucial to have a standard unit of current that is highly precise and reproducible across different laboratories and time periods. The presence of uncontrolled effects in the experimental setup would lead to variations in the realization of the Ampere, compromising the accuracy and consistency of measurements.

*   **Effort to eliminate the effect:** The effort to eliminate the effects in the Ampere definition is a move to create a stable and accurate foundation for electrical measurements worldwide. By minimizing the influence of extraneous factors, the definition of the Ampere becomes more robust, reliable, and universally applicable, ensuring the integrity and compatibility of scientific and technological endeavors.

2.  A charged particle moves in a helical path within a uniform magnetic field. Describe the factors that determine the radius and pitch (distance between consecutive turns) of this helix. How would altering the particle's initial velocity vector affect these parameters?
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content.

**Answer:**

When a charged particle enters a uniform magnetic field at an angle (other than 0° or 180°), it follows a helical path. This motion can be understood by resolving the particle's velocity into two components: one parallel to the magnetic field (v<sub>||</sub>) and one perpendicular to the magnetic field (v<sub>⊥</sub>).

**Factors Determining the Radius (r) of the Helix:**

The perpendicular component of the velocity, v<sub>⊥</sub>, is responsible for the circular motion of the particle within the magnetic field. The magnetic force (F = qvB sinθ) acts as the centripetal force, causing the particle to move in a circle. Therefore, the radius (r) of the helix is determined by the following factors:

*   **Charge (q) of the particle:** A larger charge experiences a greater magnetic force, but this is balanced by the inertial effect, so it is not directly proportional to the radius.
*   **Magnetic Field Strength (B):** A stronger magnetic field exerts a greater force on the charged particle, causing it to bend more sharply and thus reducing the radius of the circular path.  The relationship is inversely proportional, so radius decreases with increasing magnetic field.
*   **Perpendicular Velocity (v<sub>⊥</sub>):** A higher perpendicular velocity means the particle has more inertia and resists the bending effect of the magnetic force. This results in a larger radius.
*   **Mass (m) of the particle:** A heavier particle has more inertia and is harder to bend, resulting in a larger radius.

The formula for the radius of the helical path is derived from equating the magnetic force and centripetal force:

qv<sub>⊥</sub>B = mv<sub>⊥</sub><sup>2</sup>/r

Solving for r, we get:

r = mv<sub>⊥</sub> / qB

**Factors Determining the Pitch (p) of the Helix:**

The parallel component of the velocity, v<sub>||</sub>, is unaffected by the magnetic field (since the magnetic force is zero when velocity is parallel to the field). This component causes the particle to move along the direction of the magnetic field at a constant speed. The pitch (p) is the distance the particle travels along the magnetic field direction during one complete revolution in the circular path. Therefore, the pitch is determined by:

*   **Parallel Velocity (v<sub>||</sub>):** A higher parallel velocity means the particle covers more distance along the field direction in each revolution, resulting in a larger pitch.
*   **Time Period (T) of the circular motion:**  The time period is the time taken for one complete revolution in the circular path.  A longer time period (slower circular motion) combined with the parallel velocity results in a larger pitch.

The formula for the pitch of the helical path is:

p = v<sub>||</sub> * T

Where T = 2πm / qB (derived from the radius formula and the relationship v = rω, where ω = 2π/T).

Therefore,  p = v<sub>||</sub> * (2πm / qB)

**Effect of Altering the Initial Velocity Vector:**

Changing the initial velocity vector affects both the radius and the pitch of the helix:

*   **Increasing the magnitude of the initial velocity:** This increases both v<sub>||</sub> and v<sub>⊥</sub>. The radius increases due to the larger v<sub>⊥</sub>, and the pitch also increases due to the larger v<sub>||</sub>.
*   **Changing the angle between the initial velocity and the magnetic field:**
    *   Increasing the angle (θ) increases v<sub>⊥</sub> (v sinθ) and decreases v<sub>||</sub> (v cosθ). This leads to a larger radius and a smaller pitch.
    *   Decreasing the angle (θ) decreases v<sub>⊥</sub> and increases v<sub>||</sub>. This leads to a smaller radius and a larger pitch.
*   **If the initial velocity is parallel (θ = 0°) or anti-parallel (θ = 180°) to the magnetic field:** v<sub>⊥</sub> becomes zero, and the particle moves in a straight line along the magnetic field direction (no helix is formed).

In summary, the helical path is a consequence of the interplay between the circular motion caused by v<sub>⊥</sub> and the linear motion caused by v<sub>||</sub>. Altering the initial velocity changes the magnitudes of these components, thereby affecting the radius and pitch of the helix.

3.  Imagine a scenario where a current-carrying circular loop is placed near a long straight wire carrying current. Describe the forces acting on the loop. How would the loop tend to rotate or translate depending on the relative direction and magnitudes of the currents in the loop and the wire, and their relative positions? Justify your answer using relevant concepts and principles.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the forces on a current loop near a long straight wire:

**Answer:**

When a current-carrying circular loop is placed near a long, straight wire carrying current, the loop experiences forces due to the magnetic field produced by the wire. The direction and magnitude of these forces depend on the relative directions and magnitudes of the currents in the loop and the wire, as well as their relative positions.

Here's a breakdown of the forces and resulting motion:

1.  **Magnetic Field Due to the Straight Wire:**  According to Ampere's Law, a long, straight wire carrying current *I* produces a magnetic field that circles the wire.  The magnetic field's strength decreases with increasing distance from the wire.  The direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand thumb rule: if you point your right thumb in the direction of the current in the wire, your fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field.

2.  **Force on the Current Loop:** Each segment of the current loop experiences a force due to the magnetic field created by the straight wire. This force is described by the equation **F** = *I* (**l** x **B**), where *I* is the current in the loop, **l** is the length vector of the small segment (in the direction of current flow), and **B** is the magnetic field at the location of that segment.

3.  **Uneven Forces and Torque:**  Because the magnetic field from the straight wire is not uniform across the loop (it's stronger closer to the wire), the forces on different segments of the loop will have different magnitudes. This difference in forces can lead to both a net force (translation) and a net torque (rotation).

    *   **Translation:** If one side of the loop is significantly closer to the straight wire than the opposite side, the force on the closer side will be stronger.

        *   If the currents in the wire and the closer side of the loop are in the *same* direction, the force will be attractive, pulling the loop towards the wire.
        *   If the currents are in *opposite* directions, the force will be repulsive, pushing the loop away from the wire.

        The net force will cause the loop to translate (move linearly) towards or away from the wire.

    *   **Rotation (Torque):** Even if the loop is initially positioned symmetrically relative to the wire, the forces on opposite sides of the loop may not be perfectly aligned, creating a torque.  The torque tends to align the magnetic dipole moment of the loop with the magnetic field of the wire.  The magnetic dipole moment of the loop is a vector perpendicular to the plane of the loop, with its direction given by the right-hand rule (curl fingers in the direction of the current, thumb points in the direction of the magnetic moment).

        *   The loop will tend to rotate until its magnetic dipole moment is aligned with the magnetic field lines produced by the straight wire. This alignment minimizes the potential energy of the loop in the magnetic field.

4. **Equilibrium:** The loop will eventually reach a state of equilibrium where the net force and net torque on it are zero. This equilibrium position will depend on the geometry of the situation and the relative directions and magnitudes of the currents.

**In Summary:** The interaction between a current-carrying loop and a straight wire carrying current is complex. The loop experiences forces due to the wire's magnetic field, which can lead to both translation (movement towards or away from the wire) and rotation (alignment of the loop's magnetic dipole moment with the wire's magnetic field). The specific motion depends on the relative directions and magnitudes of the currents and the loop's initial position relative to the wire.
