Here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student based on the chapter content and your assignment question:

**Question:** A student is experimenting with a convex lens and a candle. They observe that when the candle is placed 30 cm from the lens, a sharp, inverted image is formed on a screen also 30 cm from the lens on the other side. Determine the focal length of the lens and describe the nature of the image formed.

**Answer:**

To solve this problem, we will use the lens formula and magnification formula.  Let's first define the known quantities based on the sign convention:

*   **Object distance (u):** -30 cm (Since the object is placed to the left of the lens, according to the sign convention, it is negative)
*   **Image distance (v):** +30 cm (Since the image is formed to the right of the lens, according to the sign convention, it is positive)

We need to find:

*   **Focal length (f):** ?

**1. Finding the Focal Length:**

We can use the lens formula to find the focal length (f):

1/f = 1/v - 1/u

Substitute the known values:

1/f = 1/30 - 1/(-30)
1/f = 1/30 + 1/30
1/f = 2/30
1/f = 1/15

Therefore, f = 15 cm

**Conclusion: The focal length of the convex lens is 15 cm.**

**2. Describing the Nature of the Image:**

We are already given that the image is inverted and sharp. Let's deduce other characteristics based on the values and the type of lens:

*   **Real:** The image is formed on a screen, which means the light rays actually converge at that point. Therefore, the image is real.
*   **Inverted:** As stated in the problem. This is typical for real images formed by convex lenses when the object is beyond the focal length.
*   **Size:** To determine the size, we can calculate the magnification (m) using the formula:

    m = v/u = 30 / (-30) = -1

    The magnification is -1. This indicates that the image is the same size as the object (since the absolute value of m is 1) and inverted (due to the negative sign).

**Final Summary of the Image's Nature:**

The image formed by the convex lens is real, inverted, and the same size as the object.  This situation (object distance = 2f) is a special case where the image distance also equals 2f, resulting in a same-size image.

**Important Points for Exams:**

*   Always state the lens formula clearly.
*   Always adhere to the sign conventions for object and image distances.  Incorrect signs will lead to the wrong answer.
*   Clearly state the units of your answer (in this case, cm for focal length).
*   Explain the nature of the image using terms like real/virtual, erect/inverted, and magnified/diminished/same size.  Support your explanation with calculations where possible (like the magnification).
*   If asked, you could also draw a ray diagram to illustrate the image formation.

2.  Explain how total internal reflection is used in optical fibers to transmit signals, and why optical fibers are preferred over traditional copper wires for long-distance communication. Discuss two practical applications of optical fibers beyond telecommunications.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter information:

**Answer:**

Total Internal Reflection (TIR) plays a crucial role in the functioning of optical fibers, enabling efficient signal transmission. Here's how it works:

*   **The Principle:** Optical fibers are thin strands of glass or plastic designed to guide light. They consist of a core (the inner part where light travels) and a cladding (an outer layer surrounding the core). The core has a higher refractive index than the cladding.
*   **Signal Transmission:** When light enters the fiber at one end, it strikes the core-cladding interface at an angle *greater* than the critical angle. Due to this, instead of refracting out into the cladding, the light undergoes Total Internal Reflection. It's completely reflected back into the core.
*   **Repeated Reflections:** This process repeats continuously along the length of the fiber. The light bounces back and forth within the core, effectively trapped inside, and travels along the fiber until it reaches the other end.

**Why Optical Fibers are Preferred over Copper Wires for Long-Distance Communication:**

Optical fibers offer several advantages over traditional copper wires for long-distance communication:

1.  **Higher Bandwidth:** Optical fibers can carry significantly more information than copper wires. They transmit data as light pulses, which have a much higher frequency than electrical signals in copper wires. This means a larger bandwidth and faster data transfer rates.
2.  **Lower Signal Attenuation:** Light signals in optical fibers experience much less signal loss (attenuation) compared to electrical signals in copper wires. This allows signals to travel much further distances without needing repeaters (devices that amplify the signal).
3.  **Immunity to Electromagnetic Interference:** Optical fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). Copper wires, on the other hand, are susceptible to these types of interference, which can degrade signal quality.
4.  **Greater Security:** It is much more difficult to tap into an optical fiber to intercept data than it is to tap into a copper wire. This makes optical fiber communication more secure.
5.  **Smaller Size and Lighter Weight:** Optical fibers are much thinner and lighter than copper wires with comparable data-carrying capacity. This makes them easier to install and manage, especially in large networks.

**Practical Applications of Optical Fibers Beyond Telecommunications:**

1.  **Medical Endoscopy:** Optical fibers are used in endoscopes to allow doctors to visualize internal organs and tissues without invasive surgery. Light is transmitted through the fiber to illuminate the area, and reflected light carrying the image is transmitted back through another fiber or set of fibers in the endoscope.
2.  **Industrial Inspection:** Optical fibers are used in industrial settings to inspect hard-to-reach areas, such as inside machinery or pipelines. They can be used to visually inspect for defects, corrosion, or other problems without the need for disassembly. They can also be bundled to create light guides for illuminating small areas.

3.  A physics enthusiast wants to build a simple telescope using two lenses. They have a lens with a long focal length (Lens A) and a lens with a short focal length (Lens B). Explain which lens should be used as the objective and which as the eyepiece, providing justification based on the principles of how a telescope creates magnified images. Also, illustrate with a ray diagram how a parallel beam of light from a distant object is focused by the telescope, showing the role of each lens.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a model answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the information provided and general knowledge of telescopes:

**Answer:**

To build a simple telescope, the lens with the *long focal length* (Lens A) should be used as the **objective lens**, and the lens with the *short focal length* (Lens B) should be used as the **eyepiece**.

**Justification:**

A telescope's primary function is to gather as much light as possible from a distant object and then magnify the image for the observer. Here's why the choice of lenses is crucial:

*   **Objective Lens (Lens A - Long Focal Length):** The objective lens is the first lens that light from the distant object encounters. A long focal length for the objective lens is essential for the following reasons:
    *   **Light Gathering Power:** A longer focal length usually corresponds to a larger diameter lens. A larger lens area gathers more light from the faint, distant object, making the image brighter.
    *   **Initial Image Formation:** The objective lens forms a real, inverted, and diminished image of the distant object at (or very near) its focal point. The longer focal length creates a larger, albeit still diminished, *initial* image compared to what a shorter focal length lens would produce. This larger initial image provides more "raw material" for the eyepiece to magnify.
*   **Eyepiece (Lens B - Short Focal Length):** The eyepiece acts as a magnifying glass to view the real image formed by the objective lens. A short focal length for the eyepiece is important because:
    *   **Magnification:** The magnification of a telescope is approximately equal to the focal length of the objective lens divided by the focal length of the eyepiece (M â‰ˆ fo/fe). Therefore, a shorter focal length for the eyepiece results in a higher overall magnification.  The eyepiece takes the real, inverted image produced by the objective and magnifies it, creating a larger, virtual, and inverted image that the observer sees.

**Ray Diagram:**

[Imagine a ray diagram here - I can't draw one in text. But the diagram should include the following:]

1.  **Two parallel rays of light** entering from the left, representing light from a distant object.  These rays should be parallel to each other but *slightly* angled with respect to the principal axis.
2.  **Lens A (Objective - Long Focal Length):** Draw a convex lens. Show the parallel rays refracting through Lens A and converging to form a real, inverted image at (or very near) the focal point of Lens A (FA). Mark this focal point on the diagram. This image should be smaller than the object, but not extremely small.
3.  **Lens B (Eyepiece - Short Focal Length):** Place another convex lens (Lens B) to the right of Lens A, positioned so that the real image formed by Lens A falls *just inside* (slightly to the left of) the focal point of Lens B (FB).
4.  **Refraction through Lens B:** Show the rays from the real image formed by Lens A refracting through Lens B. Since the image is close to the focal point of Lens B, the rays will emerge from Lens B as nearly parallel rays.  Extend these rays backward (using dashed lines) to show that they appear to originate from a larger, virtual, and inverted image located far to the left of Lens B (and therefore also to the left of Lens A).
5.  **Labeling:** Clearly label Lens A (Objective), Lens B (Eyepiece), FA (Focal point of Objective), FB (Focal point of Eyepiece), the real image formed by Lens A, and the final virtual image.

**Explanation of Ray Diagram:**

The parallel rays of light from a distant object are collected by the objective lens (Lens A). Lens A converges these rays to form a real, inverted, and diminished image at its focal point. This image then acts as the object for the eyepiece (Lens B).  The eyepiece is positioned so that this real image is slightly inside its focal point.  As a result, the rays emerging from the eyepiece are nearly parallel, meaning the final image is formed at a great distance (effectively at infinity for a relaxed eye). The observer sees a magnified, virtual, and inverted image of the distant object. The amount of magnification depends on the ratio of the focal lengths of the two lenses.

**In Summary:** Using a long focal length lens as the objective and a short focal length lens as the eyepiece allows the telescope to effectively gather light and magnify the image of distant objects.
