1.  Explain the concept of mass defect in the context of nuclear physics. How does mass defect relate to the binding energy of a nucleus, and what fundamental principle does this relationship demonstrate?
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:

**Answer:**

In nuclear physics, the **mass defect** (sometimes called mass deficiency) refers to the observation that the mass of a nucleus is *always* less than the sum of the individual masses of its constituent protons and neutrons (collectively called nucleons).

In simpler terms, if you add up the masses of all the protons and neutrons that make up an atomic nucleus, the total will be slightly *more* than the actual measured mass of the nucleus itself. This 'missing' mass is the mass defect.

**How Mass Defect Relates to Binding Energy:**

The mass defect isn't actually "missing." It has been converted into energy! This conversion is described by Einstein's famous equation, **E = mc²**, where:

*   E represents energy.
*   m represents mass.
*   c represents the speed of light (a very large number).

This equation tells us that mass and energy are interchangeable. The mass defect (m) represents the mass that has been converted into the **binding energy (E)** of the nucleus. The binding energy is the energy required to break the nucleus apart into its individual protons and neutrons. In other words, it's the energy that holds the nucleus together.

Therefore, a larger mass defect means a larger binding energy, indicating a more stable nucleus. The example in the provided content mentions finding the energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit. This demonstrates how even a small amount of mass is equivalent to a substantial amount of energy because it is multiplied by the square of the speed of light.

**Fundamental Principle Demonstrated:**

The relationship between mass defect and binding energy demonstrates the fundamental principle of **mass-energy equivalence**, as stated by Einstein's equation. It shows that mass is a form of energy and that energy can be converted into mass and vice versa. In the case of the nucleus, some of the mass of the nucleons is converted into the energy that binds them together, resulting in the observed mass defect.

2.  A hypothetical nuclear reaction involves the transformation of element X into element Y. If the total mass of the reactants is slightly *greater* than the total mass of the products, predict whether this reaction will release or absorb energy. Justify your answer using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, designed for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:

**Answer:**

In the hypothetical nuclear reaction where element X transforms into element Y, and the total mass of the reactants (element X) is slightly *greater* than the total mass of the products (element Y), the reaction will **release** energy.

**Justification using Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence Principle (E=mc²):**

Einstein's famous equation, E=mc², demonstrates the fundamental relationship between mass and energy.  It states that mass and energy are interchangeable.  In this equation:

*   E represents energy.
*   m represents mass.
*   c represents the speed of light in a vacuum (a very large constant).

The principle implies that a change in mass is directly proportional to a change in energy. Because 'c' is squared, even a tiny change in mass results in a significant change in energy.

In our scenario, the total mass of the reactants is *greater* than the total mass of the products. This difference in mass, often referred to as the "mass defect," indicates that some of the initial mass has been converted into energy during the reaction.

Since mass has decreased (from reactants to products), energy must have been released, in accordance with E=mc². The "missing" mass has been transformed into kinetic energy of the products (element Y) and/or other forms of energy, such as gamma radiation.

Therefore, based on Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, the reaction will release energy (it is an exothermic reaction).

3.  Imagine you have a sample containing 'n' number of atomic mass units (amu). Describe a step-by-step process to calculate the total energy equivalent of this sample in Joules, given the energy equivalent of 1 amu.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter excerpt:

**Answer:**

To calculate the total energy equivalent of a sample containing 'n' atomic mass units (amu) in Joules, follow these steps:

**1. Understand the Fundamental Concept:**

   The key concept here is Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, expressed by the famous equation E = mc², where:

   *   E is energy (typically in Joules)
   *   m is mass (typically in kilograms)
   *   c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s)

   This equation tells us that mass and energy are interchangeable.  A small amount of mass can be converted into a tremendous amount of energy, and vice versa. In the context of nuclear physics, the mass of an atomic nucleus is *less* than the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. This "missing" mass, called the mass defect, is converted into the binding energy that holds the nucleus together.

**2. Know the Energy Equivalent of 1 amu:**

   The chapter excerpt provides that the energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit (amu) can be calculated using E=mc². While the excert doesn't have the explicit calculation or value, it's crucial to remember that:
    * 1 amu = 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg

**3. Calculate the Total Mass in Kilograms:**

   Since we have 'n' atomic mass units, the total mass (m) in kilograms is:

   m = n * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu)

**4. Apply Einstein's Equation:**

   Now that we have the total mass (m) in kilograms, we can calculate the total energy equivalent (E) in Joules using Einstein's equation:

   E = m * c²
   E = [n * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu)] * (3 x 10⁸ m/s)²

**5. Simplify the Calculation:**

   E = n * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) * (9 x 10¹⁶ m²/s²)
   E = n * (1.49445 x 10⁻¹⁰ J/amu)
   E ≈ n * (1.5 x 10⁻¹⁰ J/amu)

**6. Final Result:**

   The total energy equivalent (E) of 'n' atomic mass units is approximately:

   E ≈ n * (1.5 x 10⁻¹⁰) Joules

**In summary, the steps are:**

1.  Convert the number of atomic mass units ('n') into total mass in kilograms.
2.  Use Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation (E=mc²) to calculate the total energy in Joules.

**Important Notes:**

*   Make sure to use consistent units throughout the calculation (kilograms for mass, meters per second for the speed of light, and Joules for energy).
*   This calculation provides the energy equivalent of the *mass* itself. In nuclear reactions, only a fraction of the mass is typically converted into energy.
*   The provided example values (mass of iron nucleus) are for illustrative purposes. This general method applies to calculating the energy equivalent of any mass.
