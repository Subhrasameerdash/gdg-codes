**Maxwell's Bridge: Displacement Current and Ampere's Law**

Maxwell's introduction of the displacement current was a crucial step in resolving an inconsistency in Ampere's Law. This inconsistency arose when applying Ampere's Law to situations involving charging capacitors.

**The Inconsistency:**

Ampere's Law, in its original form, states that the integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is proportional to the current (I) passing through any surface bounded by that loop:

∮ B ⋅ dl = μ₀I

Now, consider a parallel-plate capacitor being charged by a current 'I'. Imagine two different surfaces, S1 and S2, both bounded by the same loop (a circle around the wire connecting to the capacitor).

*   **Surface S1:** This surface is a flat disk that intersects the wire carrying the current 'I' to the capacitor. According to Ampere's Law, the magnetic field integral around the loop would be proportional to 'I' because the current 'I' passes through S1.

*   **Surface S2:** This surface is shaped like a balloon that bulges out between the capacitor plates.  Because it passes *between* the plates, the conduction current 'I' does *not* pass through S2.  If we applied the original Ampere's Law here, we'd incorrectly conclude that the magnetic field integral around the same loop is zero, since no conduction current passes through S2.

This is a clear contradiction!  The magnetic field around the loop cannot simultaneously be proportional to 'I' and be zero. This suggests that something is missing in Ampere's Law.

**Maxwell's Solution: Displacement Current**

Maxwell realized that even though there is no actual flow of charges (conduction current) between the capacitor plates, the *changing electric field* between the plates creates an equivalent current, which he termed the **displacement current (Id)**.

The displacement current is defined as:

Id = ε₀ (dΦE/dt)

where:

*   ε₀ is the permittivity of free space.
*   ΦE is the electric flux through the surface (in this case, between the capacitor plates).
*   dΦE/dt is the rate of change of electric flux with respect to time.

**The Modified Ampere's Law (Ampere-Maxwell Law):**

Maxwell modified Ampere's Law by adding the displacement current term:

∮ B ⋅ dl = μ₀(I + Id)

Now, Ampere's Law is consistent regardless of the surface chosen.

*   **For Surface S1:** The displacement current Id is zero, and the conduction current is I.  The equation simplifies to the original Ampere's Law.

*   **For Surface S2:** The conduction current I is zero, but the displacement current Id is non-zero and equal to the conduction current I (since the changing electric field between the plates is directly related to the charging current). Therefore, ∮ B ⋅ dl = μ₀Id = μ₀I, giving the same result as for Surface S1.

*   S1 is a surface intersecting the wire, carrying the conduction current I.
*   S2 is a surface between the capacitor plates, where only displacement current exists.
*   The loop is the Amperian loop used to apply Ampere's Law.

**Why was this correction pivotal?**

Maxwell's inclusion of the displacement current was far more than just a "correction." It was a revolutionary insight because it:

1.  **Ensured the logical consistency of electromagnetism:**  It resolved a fundamental contradiction in Ampere's Law, making the theory self-consistent.

2.  **Predicted Electromagnetic Waves:**  The modified Ampere's Law, combined with Faraday's Law of Induction, revealed a beautiful symmetry in electromagnetism.  A changing magnetic field creates an electric field (Faraday's Law), and a changing electric field *also* creates a magnetic field (Maxwell's addition to Ampere's Law). This mutual generation of electric and magnetic fields allows for self-sustaining electromagnetic waves to propagate through space, even in a vacuum. Maxwell derived a wave equation from his equations and calculated the speed of these waves.  This speed turned out to be equal to the speed of light, strongly suggesting that light itself is an electromagnetic wave.

3. **Unified Electricity, Magnetism, and Optics:**  Maxwell's theory provided a unified framework for understanding electricity, magnetism, and light as different manifestations of the same fundamental phenomenon: electromagnetism.

In summary, the displacement current was not just a minor fix to Ampere's Law; it was the key that unlocked a deeper understanding of electromagnetism and led to the prediction and eventual discovery of electromagnetic waves, transforming our understanding of the universe.

2.  **Spectrum Sleuth:** Imagine you have discovered a new type of electromagnetic radiation. Design an experiment to determine its frequency and wavelength. Describe the principles behind your method and how you would classify this radiation within the electromagnetic spectrum based on your findings, comparing it to a known EM wave.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT content, and designed to address the "Spectrum Sleuth" assignment question:

**Answer:**

Okay, I've discovered a new type of electromagnetic radiation, and I need to figure out where it fits in the electromagnetic spectrum! Here's how I'd design an experiment to determine its frequency and wavelength and then classify it.

**Experiment Design:**

Since I don't know the properties of this new radiation, I'll use a two-pronged approach, attempting to measure both its frequency and wavelength independently. This will allow me to verify my results using the fundamental relationship:  *c = fλ* (where *c* is the speed of light, *f* is frequency, and *λ* is wavelength).

**1. Wavelength Determination (Using Interference):**

*   **Principle:** I'll use the principle of interference, similar to Young's double-slit experiment, but adapted for this unknown radiation. The setup involves passing the radiation through two narrow, parallel slits.  The waves emerging from the slits will interfere, creating a pattern of constructive (bright) and destructive (dark) interference fringes on a screen placed at a distance behind the slits.

*   **Setup:**
    *   **Source:** A controlled source of the new radiation. I'll need a way to generate a consistent and preferably monochromatic (single frequency) beam.  Initially, this might just be the device that discovered it.
    *   **Double Slit:**  Two closely spaced slits, with a known separation distance (*d*). The size and spacing of the slits might need to be adjusted based on initial observations. Smaller wavelengths need smaller slits.
    *   **Detector Screen:** A screen (or a linear detector array) to observe the interference pattern. The detector needs to be sensitive to the new radiation.
    *   **Detector:** A means to detect the presence and intensity of the radiation. This is critical. This could be a thermal detector if the radiation carries significant heat, or some novel material which reacts to the radiation.

*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Shine the radiation through the double slit.
    2.  Observe the interference pattern on the screen.
    3.  Measure the distance (*y*) between adjacent bright fringes (or dark fringes).
    4.  Measure the distance (*L*) between the double slit and the screen.

*   **Calculation:**
    The wavelength (*λ*) can be calculated using the formula:  *λ = (y * d) / L*

**2. Frequency Determination (Using Resonance):**

*   **Principle:** Electromagnetic radiation can induce resonance in circuits with specific inductance (L) and capacitance (C) values.  The resonant frequency of an LC circuit is given by: *f = 1 / (2π√(LC))*

*   **Setup:**
    *   **LC Circuit:** Build a series LC circuit. The inductance and capacitance should be variable, allowing me to tune the circuit.
    *   **Antenna:** A small antenna connected to the LC circuit to receive the radiation.
    *   **Detection Circuit:** A circuit to detect the maximum current or voltage in the LC circuit, indicating resonance. This could be a simple ammeter or voltmeter.

*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Expose the LC circuit's antenna to the new radiation.
    2.  Vary the capacitance (or inductance) of the LC circuit.
    3.  Observe the current or voltage in the circuit. A peak indicates resonance.
    4.  Record the values of L and C at which resonance occurs.

*   **Calculation:**
    Calculate the frequency (*f*) using the formula: *f = 1 / (2π√(LC))*

**Classification within the Electromagnetic Spectrum:**

1.  **Calculate Wavelength and Frequency:** Obtain reliable values for both *λ* and *f* from the experiments described above. Crucially, verify that *c = fλ* holds true.

2.  **Compare to Known EM Waves:** Compare the calculated wavelength and frequency to the known ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays).

    *   **Example:** If my measurements yield a wavelength of 1 mm and a frequency of 300 GHz, this falls within the microwave region of the spectrum.

3.  **Investigate Absorption Properties:** Examine how the radiation interacts with different materials. Does it penetrate certain substances easily? Is it absorbed by water? This can provide further clues for classification.

4.  **Comparison to Microwaves:** Let's say my measurements place this new radiation in the microwave spectrum.  I would then compare its properties to known microwave radiation:

    *   **Similarities:** Does it heat water molecules (like in a microwave oven)? Is it used in communication technologies?
    *   **Differences:** What is its intensity compared to standard microwaves? Does it have any unique interactions with matter that differ from standard microwaves?

**Conclusion:**

By carefully measuring the wavelength and frequency using interference and resonance techniques, and then comparing these values (and the radiation's properties) to known regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, I can confidently classify this new type of electromagnetic radiation. The comparative analysis, as shown with the example, is crucial.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Detector Sensitivity:** The most significant challenge is likely to be creating a detector sensitive to the unknown radiation. This may require exploring novel materials or detector technologies.
*   **Monochromatic Source:** Ideally, the source of radiation should be as close to monochromatic as possible. This will make the interference pattern clearer and the resonance peak sharper.
*   **Safety:** Depending on the energy of the radiation, appropriate safety precautions must be taken.

This comprehensive approach, combining independent measurements of wavelength and frequency, along with a comparison to known EM waves, provides a robust method for characterizing and classifying new electromagnetic radiation.

3.  **Capacitor Conundrum:** A parallel-plate capacitor with square plates of side length 'a' and separation 'd' is being charged by a time-varying voltage V(t) = V₀sin(ωt). Derive an expression for the displacement current flowing between the plates in terms of a, d, V₀, ω, and the permittivity of free space, ε₀. Explain how this displacement current contributes to the magnetic field between the capacitor plates.
Sample Answer:
**Answer:**

**1. Understanding Displacement Current**

The displacement current, a concept introduced by Maxwell, is a crucial aspect of understanding electromagnetism, especially in situations involving changing electric fields, like a charging capacitor. It acts as an "effective current" that produces a magnetic field, just like a regular conduction current. It's defined as:

Id = ε₀ (dΦE/dt)

where:

*   Id is the displacement current
*   ε₀ is the permittivity of free space (8.854 x 10⁻¹² C²/Nm²)
*   ΦE is the electric flux through the area
*   d/dt represents the rate of change with respect to time.

**2. Applying to the Parallel-Plate Capacitor**

In our case, we have a parallel-plate capacitor with square plates of side 'a' and separation 'd'. The voltage across the plates is given by V(t) = V₀sin(ωt).

**3. Finding the Electric Field**

The electric field (E) between the capacitor plates is uniform and can be related to the voltage (V) and the separation (d) by:

E = V/d = (V₀sin(ωt))/d

**4. Calculating the Electric Flux**

The electric flux (ΦE) through the area of one of the square plates is:

ΦE = E * A = E * a² = (V₀sin(ωt) * a²) / d

**5. Deriving the Displacement Current**

Now we can find the displacement current by taking the time derivative of the electric flux and multiplying by ε₀:

Id = ε₀ (dΦE/dt) = ε₀ * d/dt [(V₀sin(ωt) * a²) / d]

Since ε₀, V₀, a², and d are all constants, we can take them out of the derivative:

Id = (ε₀ * V₀ * a²) / d * d/dt [sin(ωt)]

The derivative of sin(ωt) with respect to time is ωcos(ωt):

Id = (ε₀ * V₀ * a² * ω * cos(ωt)) / d

**Therefore, the expression for the displacement current flowing between the plates is:**

**Id = (ε₀ * V₀ * a² * ω * cos(ωt)) / d**

**6. Contribution to the Magnetic Field**

The displacement current, just like a real current, creates a magnetic field. According to Ampere-Maxwell's Law, the line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is proportional to the sum of the conduction current (Ic) and the displacement current (Id) enclosed by the loop:

∮ B ⋅ dl = μ₀ (Ic + Id)

where μ₀ is the permeability of free space.

In the region between the capacitor plates, there is no conduction current (Ic = 0). Therefore, the magnetic field is solely due to the displacement current:

∮ B ⋅ dl = μ₀ * Id

This means that as the capacitor charges and the displacement current flows, a magnetic field is generated between the plates. The strength of this magnetic field is directly proportional to the magnitude of the displacement current and therefore varies sinusoidally with time, following the cos(ωt) term in the Id equation.

**In summary, the changing electric field between the capacitor plates creates a displacement current, which in turn generates a magnetic field in the same region, demonstrating the fundamental relationship between electric and magnetic fields described by Maxwell's equations.**
