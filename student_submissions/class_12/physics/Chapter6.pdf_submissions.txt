1.  **Conceptual Application:** A flexible conducting loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field directed into the page. Describe three distinct actions you could take to the loop itself (without changing the external magnetic field) that would induce a current within the loop. For each action, explain *why* it induces a current, relating your reasoning to Faraday's Law and Lenz's Law.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the assignment question, drawing upon the provided NCERT chapter content:

**Answer:**

To induce a current in a flexible conducting loop placed in a uniform magnetic field (directed into the page) without changing the external magnetic field, we need to change the magnetic flux through the loop. According to Faraday's Law (ε = -dΦB/dt), a changing magnetic flux (ΦB) induces an electromotive force (EMF), which drives the current. Lenz's Law dictates that the induced current's magnetic field will oppose the *change* in the original magnetic flux.

Here are three distinct actions and explanations:

1.  **Changing the Area of the Loop:**

    *   **Action:** Squeeze the flexible loop, decreasing its area. Imagine starting with a roughly circular loop and deforming it into a narrow ellipse.
    *   **Explanation:** Initially, the loop encloses a certain magnetic flux (ΦB = B⋅A = BAcosθ). Since the magnetic field (B) is uniform and directed into the page, and the area vector (A) is perpendicular to the page,  θ = 0°, the initial flux is BA. When you squeeze the loop, you decrease the area (A). This reduces the magnetic flux through the loop (dΦB/dt < 0). According to Faraday's Law, this change in flux induces an EMF and, therefore, a current. Lenz's Law tells us the direction of the induced current. Since we *decreased* the flux into the page, the induced current will create its own magnetic field *into* the page to *oppose* that decrease. This requires a clockwise current flow (following the right-hand rule: point your thumb into the page, your fingers curl in the direction of the current).

2.  **Rotating Part of the Loop (While Keeping the Rest Fixed):**

    *   **Action:** Hold one part of the flexible loop fixed and twist or rotate the remaining section out of the plane of the page.
    *   **Explanation:** Initially, the entire loop lies in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, maximizing the flux (ΦB = BA). When you rotate part of the loop, that section's area vector (A) now makes an angle (θ) with the magnetic field (B).  The flux through that *section* is now BAcosθ. Since θ is increasing as you rotate, cosθ is decreasing, and thus the flux through the *entire* loop decreases. The rate of change of flux (dΦB/dt) is negative and Faraday's Law indicates the induced EMF. Lenz's Law: Since we're effectively reducing the flux into the page, the induced current will try to *increase* the flux into the page. The direction of the induced current would depend on the orientation and geometry of the conducting loop.

3.  **Wobbling or Oscillating the Loop:**

    *   **Action:** Hold the loop at two points and cause it to oscillate or "wobble" back and forth, so that the plane of the loop is constantly changing its orientation relative to the magnetic field.
    *   **Explanation:**  As the loop wobbles, the angle (θ) between the area vector (A) and the magnetic field (B) continuously changes.  This means the magnetic flux through the loop (ΦB = BAcosθ) is also continuously changing (dΦB/dt ≠ 0). The flux will increase and decrease periodically. Faraday's Law tells us that this changing flux induces an EMF.  Lenz's Law tells us that the direction of the induced current will change direction as the flux increases and decreases. The current will flow in one direction as the flux is increasing into the page, and in the opposite direction as the flux is decreasing into the page. The constantly changing flux causes an AC current to flow in the loop.

2.  **Comparative Analysis:** Imagine two solenoids, A and B, placed close to each other. Solenoid A has a larger number of turns and a longer length compared to Solenoid B, but both have the same cross-sectional area and carry the same changing current.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT content.

**Answer:**

The question asks us to compare the mutual inductance between two solenoids, A and B, given that solenoid A has a larger number of turns and a longer length than solenoid B, but they share the same cross-sectional area and experience the same changing current.  To understand this, we need to analyze the factors that influence mutual inductance.

**Understanding Mutual Inductance (M):**

Mutual inductance (M) describes how effectively a change in current in one coil (the primary coil) induces an EMF in another nearby coil (the secondary coil).  A higher mutual inductance means a larger induced EMF in the secondary coil for the same change in current in the primary coil.  The formula for the mutual inductance between two solenoids placed close together (assuming one is completely inside the other or they are wound on the same core) can be approximated.

**Factors Affecting Mutual Inductance:**

*   **Number of Turns:** A larger number of turns in *either* solenoid will increase the mutual inductance. More turns in the primary solenoid (where the current is changing) creates a stronger magnetic field, and more turns in the secondary solenoid means a greater EMF is induced as that field passes through them.
*   **Cross-Sectional Area (A):** A larger cross-sectional area allows more magnetic flux to link the two coils, increasing the mutual inductance. Since both coils have the same area, this factor is constant in our comparison.
*   **Length (l):**  A longer length of the primary solenoid *decreases* the magnetic field strength inside the solenoid for a given current and number of turns *per unit length*.
*   **Permeability of the Core (μ):**  If the solenoids are wound on a core material (like iron), the permeability of that material significantly affects the mutual inductance.  A higher permeability (μ) allows for a much stronger magnetic field to be created for the same current. Since this information not provided here, assume the permeability is constant for the problem.

**Analysis of Solenoids A and B:**

Let's break down the comparison:

*   **Solenoid A:** Has a *larger number of turns* and a *longer length* compared to B.
*   **Solenoid B:** Has a *smaller number of turns* and a *shorter length* compared to A.
*   **Both:** Have the *same cross-sectional area* (A) and carry the *same changing current* (dI/dt).

**Conclusion:**

Determining which solenoid pair exhibits greater mutual inductance requires careful consideration:

* Larger number of turns of Solenoid A increases the mutual inductance.
* Longer length of Solenoid A decreases the mutual inductance.

Because of the complexity of the interaction of these parameters, the problem can not be solved. To solve the problem, it must be assumed that the two solenoids are sharing the same length, or the problem must ask about the mutual inductance of Solenoid B inside Solenoid A.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Assumptions:** This analysis assumes the solenoids are close enough that most of the magnetic flux from one links with the other.
*   **Ideal Solenoids:**  The formulas used are approximations for "ideal" solenoids (long and tightly wound).  Real-world solenoids may deviate from these ideal behaviors.

3.  **Problem Solving and Design:** You are tasked with designing a simple AC generator for a classroom demonstration. You have a coil of wire with *N* turns, a strong permanent magnet, and the materials necessary to build a rotating mechanism. Outline the key design considerations, including how you would maximize the induced EMF and how the frequency of the generated AC voltage is related to the generator's physical parameters. Support your answers with relevant formulas.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student addressing the AC generator design question, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:

**Answer:**

Designing a simple AC generator for a classroom demonstration involves several key considerations to maximize the induced EMF and achieve a desired frequency. Here's an outline:

**1. Key Design Considerations:**

*   **Number of Turns (N):** Faraday's Law states that the induced EMF (ε) is directly proportional to the number of turns in the coil (ε = -N dΦB/dt). Therefore, a larger number of turns will result in a greater induced EMF.  We should aim for as many turns as practically possible, considering the physical space limitations.

*   **Coil Area (A):** The magnetic flux (ΦB) through the coil is given by ΦB = B⋅A = BAcosθ, where B is the magnetic field strength and A is the area vector of the coil. A larger coil area will increase the magnetic flux and, consequently, the induced EMF. The area should be maximized within the constraints of the magnet's size and the generator's overall dimensions.  A circular or rectangular coil shape is generally easiest to construct.

*   **Magnetic Field Strength (B):** A stronger magnetic field will also increase the magnetic flux and the induced EMF. We should use the strongest permanent magnet available.  Consider using a horseshoe magnet to concentrate the magnetic field lines through the coil.

*   **Rotation Speed (ω):**  The rate of change of magnetic flux (dΦB/dt) is directly related to the angular speed (ω) of the coil's rotation.  A faster rotation will result in a more rapid change in flux and a higher induced EMF.

*   **Orientation of the Coil:** The induced EMF is maximized when the rate of change of flux is greatest. This occurs when the coil is rotating through the position where its plane is perpendicular to the magnetic field (θ = 0° or 180°).

**2. Maximizing the Induced EMF:**

To maximize the induced EMF, we should:

*   Use a coil with a large number of turns (N).
*   Maximize the area (A) of the coil, within practical limitations.
*   Employ the strongest available permanent magnet to generate a high magnetic field strength (B).
*   Rotate the coil at the highest possible, consistent, and controllable angular speed (ω).
*   Ensure that the coil rotates smoothly and consistently through the magnetic field.  This might involve using bearings to minimize friction.

**3. Frequency of Generated AC Voltage:**

The frequency (f) of the generated AC voltage is directly related to the angular speed (ω) of the generator's rotation.  The relationship is:

`ω = 2πf`   or   `f = ω / (2π)`

Where:

*   `f` is the frequency in Hertz (Hz), which represents the number of complete cycles per second.
*   `ω` is the angular speed in radians per second (rad/s).

Therefore, the frequency of the AC voltage can be controlled by adjusting the rotation speed of the coil.  A higher rotation speed will result in a higher frequency.

**4. Overall Design Outline**

1. Select the coil with as many turns as possible and calculate the area.
2. Select the strongest available magnet for the setup.
3. Create a rotating mechanism using available materials and try to control the rotation frequency.
4. Connect a multimeter to the setup and observe the AC voltage and calculate the frequency.

**In summary:** To build an effective classroom AC generator, we need to maximize the number of coil turns, coil area, and magnetic field strength, and control the rotation speed. Understanding the relationship between angular speed and frequency allows us to design a generator that produces AC voltage at a desired frequency for demonstration purposes. By carefully considering these factors, we can create a functional and educational AC generator model.
