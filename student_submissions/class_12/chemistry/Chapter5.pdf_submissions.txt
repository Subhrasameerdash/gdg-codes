Determine the structural formulas of isomers A and B, providing IUPAC names for each. Explain the difference in their reactivity with AgNO3 based on the nature of the chloride ions in the complex.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the provided question about coordination isomers and their reactivity:

**Answer:**

Let's analyze the coordination compound CoCl3.5NH3 and its isomers A and B, considering their differing reactions with AgNO3.

**1. Determining the Structural Formulas:**

*   **Isomer A:** Reacts with AgNO3 to produce 2 moles of AgCl per mole of the compound. This indicates that two chloride ions are *outside* the coordination sphere as counter ions, and can precipitate with silver ions. This means that one Cl- is inside the coordination sphere. Given that there are 5 NH3 ligands, and 1 Cl- inside the coordination sphere, the coordination number of Co is 6, and the formula can be written as [CoCl(NH3)5]Cl2.

*   **Isomer B:** Does *not* react with AgNO3. This implies that all three chloride ions are *inside* the coordination sphere, and therefore not free to react with silver ions to form AgCl precipitate. Since the total number of ligands in the complex is 5 NH3 and 3 Cl-, the number of ligands are 8 which can not be correct since the coordination number can not exceed 6. Therefore, the question must have made a typo and the number of ligands must be 5 instead of 6. The formula for Isomer B is [CoCl3(NH3)3].

**2. IUPAC Names:**

*   **Isomer A ([CoCl(NH3)5]Cl2):** Pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) chloride

*   **Isomer B ([CoCl3(NH3)3]):** Triamminetrichloridocobalt(III)

**3. Explanation of Reactivity Difference with AgNO3:**

The difference in reactivity arises from the location of the chloride ions relative to the coordination sphere:

*   **Isomer A:** In [CoCl(NH3)5]Cl2, the two chloride ions outside the square brackets are *counter ions*. When this compound is dissolved in water, these chloride ions dissociate and are free in solution. When AgNO3 is added, these free chloride ions react with silver ions (Ag+) to form insoluble silver chloride (AgCl) precipitate:

    2Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq) + 2AgNO3(aq) → 2AgCl(s) + 2NO3<sup>-</sup>(aq)

    The chloride ion *inside* the coordination sphere (directly bonded to the cobalt ion) is tightly bound and does *not* participate in this precipitation reaction.

*   **Isomer B:** In [CoCl3(NH3)3], all three chloride ions are ligands directly coordinated (bonded) to the cobalt(III) ion within the coordination sphere. These chloride ions are not free in solution and are not available to react with silver ions. Therefore, no AgCl precipitate forms when AgNO3 is added. These chloride ions are covalently bonded to the Cobalt ion and are tightly held within the coordination complex.

2.  Consider two complexes: [Fe(CN)6]4- and [Fe(H2O)6]2+. Explain why one is considered a homoleptic complex and the other a heteroleptic complex. Determine and compare the oxidation state of iron in each complex. Further, based on ligand properties, predict which complex will exhibit a higher crystal field splitting energy (Δo) and justify your reasoning.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:

**Answer:**

Let's analyze the two complexes, \[Fe(CN)6]4- and \[Fe(H2O)6]2+, step-by-step:

**1. Homoleptic vs. Heteroleptic:**

*   **\[Fe(CN)6]4-:** This complex is considered **homoleptic** because the iron(II) ion is coordinated *only* to cyanide (CN-) ligands. There is only *one* type of ligand bound to the central metal.
*   **\[Fe(H2O)6]2+:** This complex is also considered **homoleptic** because the iron(II) ion is coordinated *only* to water (H2O) ligands. There is only *one* type of ligand bound to the central metal.

**2. Oxidation State of Iron:**

To determine the oxidation state of iron in each complex, we'll use the following equation:

Oxidation State of Metal + (Total Charge of Ligands) = Overall Charge of Complex

*   **\[Fe(CN)6]4-:**
    *   Let the oxidation state of Fe be 'x'.
    *   The charge of each CN- ligand is -1.  There are 6 CN- ligands, so the total charge from the ligands is -6.
    *   The overall charge of the complex is -4.
    *   Therefore, x + (-6) = -4  =>  x = +2
    *   The oxidation state of iron in \[Fe(CN)6]4- is +2.

*   **\[Fe(H2O)6]2+:**
    *   Let the oxidation state of Fe be 'x'.
    *   Water (H2O) is a neutral ligand, so its charge is 0. The total charge from the ligands is 0.
    *   The overall charge of the complex is +2.
    *   Therefore, x + (0) = +2  =>  x = +2
    *   The oxidation state of iron in \[Fe(H2O)6]2+ is +2.

Therefore, the oxidation state of iron is **+2** in both complexes.

**3. Crystal Field Splitting Energy (Δo):**

Crystal Field Splitting Energy (Δo) depends on the nature of the ligands. Ligands are arranged in a spectrochemical series based on their ability to cause splitting of the d-orbitals.  Strong field ligands cause a larger splitting (higher Δo), while weak field ligands cause a smaller splitting (lower Δo).

In the spectrochemical series, cyanide (CN-) is a strong field ligand, while water (H2O) is a weak field ligand.

*   **Prediction:** \[Fe(CN)6]4- will exhibit a higher crystal field splitting energy (Δo) compared to \[Fe(H2O)6]2+.

*   **Justification:** CN- is a stronger field ligand than H2O. Stronger field ligands interact more strongly with the metal d-orbitals, leading to a greater energy difference between the eg and t2g sets of d-orbitals. This increased energy difference *is* the crystal field splitting energy (Δo). Thus, the complex with CN- ligands will have a larger Δo value.

3.  A student performs an experiment with a coordination compound and observes the following: The compound has the empirical formula PtCl2.2NH3. The compound does not have any geometrical isomers. Draw the structure of the compound. What is the coordination number of platinum in this complex? What is the shape of this complex?
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer appropriate for a CBSE Class 11-12 student tackling that coordination compound problem:

**Answer:**

To determine the structure of the coordination compound PtCl2.2NH3, we need to consider the information provided: the empirical formula and the absence of geometrical isomers.

1. **Determining the Coordination Sphere:** Since platinum (Pt) is a transition metal, it's likely to form a coordination complex.  All the components of the empirical formula (PtCl2.2NH3) must be within the coordination sphere, thus the molecule is \[PtCl2(NH3)2].

2. **Possible Geometries and Isomerism:** Platinum(II) complexes commonly exhibit square planar or tetrahedral geometries. Let's consider both:

    *   **Tetrahedral:** If the complex were tetrahedral, there would be only one possible arrangement of the ligands. All the ligands are equidistant from each other, and since the ligands can occupy any spot in the tetrahedral structure, the structure would be the same regardless of the permutation of the position of the ligands.

    *   **Square Planar:** If the complex were square planar, two geometrical isomers would be possible:
        *   *cis*-\[PtCl2(NH3)2]: The two chloride ligands (Cl) are adjacent to each other, and the two ammonia ligands (NH3) are adjacent to each other.
        *   *trans*-\[PtCl2(NH3)2]: The two chloride ligands (Cl) are opposite each other, and the two ammonia ligands (NH3) are opposite each other.

3. **Applying the Given Information:** The problem states that the compound *does not* have any geometrical isomers. This rules out the possibility of a square planar complex with *cis* and *trans* isomers. Therefore, for the compound to only have one form, it must be tetrahedral.

4.  **Drawing the Structure:**
(Since I cannot draw here, imagine Pt at the center of a tetrahedron, with two NH3 and two Cl ligands at the corners.)

5.  **Coordination Number:** The coordination number of platinum in this complex is 4 because there are four ligands (2 Cl- and 2 NH3) directly bonded to the central platinum atom/ion.

6.  **Shape of the Complex:** Based on our reasoning, the shape of the complex \[PtCl2(NH3)2] is tetrahedral.

**In summary:**

*   **Structure:** The complex is \[PtCl2(NH3)2] and the shape is tetrahedral.
*   **Coordination Number:** 4
*   **Shape:** Tetrahedral.
