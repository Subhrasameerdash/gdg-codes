1.  **Conceptual Application:** Explain, using the concepts of stress, strain, and elastic moduli, why bridges are often designed with trusses (lattice-like structures) rather than solid beams of the same material. Consider the different types of stress experienced by the bridge structure.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the question about bridge design:

Bridges are often designed with trusses (lattice-like structures) instead of solid beams of the same material to maximize strength and minimize material usage, leveraging the concepts of stress, strain, and elastic moduli. Here's a breakdown of why:

*   **Stress Distribution:** A solid beam under load experiences a variety of stresses. The top of the beam experiences compressive stress (being squeezed), while the bottom experiences tensile stress (being stretched). The material in the middle, near the neutral axis, experiences relatively little stress.

*   **Inefficient Material Use in Solid Beams:** Because the material near the neutral axis in a solid beam contributes little to the beam's resistance to bending, a significant portion of the material is essentially underutilized. This makes solid beams heavier and less efficient for their load-bearing capacity.

*   **Trusses and Targeted Stress Management:** Trusses, on the other hand, are designed to distribute the load along a network of interconnected members. These members are strategically placed to primarily experience either **tensile stress** or **compressive stress**. By using individual components optimized for tension or compression, the truss structure ensures that virtually all the material bears significant stress.

*   **Elastic Moduli and Material Selection:** The specific arrangement of the truss and the materials used are selected based on their **Young's modulus (Y)**. Steel, with its high Young's modulus, is a common choice because it can withstand large stresses with minimal strain (deformation). The design aims to keep the stresses within the **elastic limit** of the material, ensuring the bridge returns to its original shape after the load is removed.

*   **Shear Stress Considerations:** While tensile and compressive stresses are dominant in truss members, **shear stress** also plays a role, especially at the joints where members connect. The design of these joints is crucial to withstand shear forces and prevent failure.

*   **Weight Reduction and Cost-Effectiveness:** By using trusses, engineers can significantly reduce the overall weight of the bridge compared to a solid beam of equivalent strength. This leads to several advantages:

    *   **Reduced Material Costs:** Less material is required to achieve the desired strength.
    *   **Easier Transportation and Construction:** Lighter components are easier to transport and assemble.
    *   **Reduced Load on Supports:** The lighter bridge structure puts less stress on the bridge's foundations and supports.

In summary, trusses are a clever engineering solution that maximizes the strength-to-weight ratio by efficiently distributing stress among its members, utilizing the material's elastic properties, and minimizing wasted material. This makes them a more cost-effective and practical choice for bridge construction compared to solid beams, especially for longer spans where weight becomes a critical factor.

2.  **Comparative Analysis:** Imagine you need to select a material for a cable in a crane designed to lift heavy loads. You have two options: steel with a high Young's modulus or a polymer with a lower Young's modulus but significantly higher elastic limit. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each material choice, considering both the material properties and the practical implications for the crane's performance and safety.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student addressing the comparative analysis question about material selection for a crane cable:

**Answer:**

Choosing the right material for a crane cable is a crucial decision that involves balancing different material properties with the practical requirements of the application. Let's analyze the two options: steel (high Young's modulus) and a polymer (lower Young's modulus, higher elastic limit).

**Steel Cable:**

*   **Advantages:**
    *   **High Young's Modulus:** Steel's high Young's modulus (Y) indicates its stiffness. This means it will deform less under a given load compared to the polymer.  A lower strain (elongation) is desirable in a crane cable because excessive stretching can lead to inaccurate load placement and potential instability.  The crane operator needs to have precise control over the load position.
    *   **Strength:** Steel generally possesses high tensile strength, meaning it can withstand large tensile stresses before breaking. This is essential for lifting heavy loads safely.
    *   **Well-Established Technology:** Steel cables are a well-established and understood technology.  There is a wealth of knowledge and experience in their manufacture, use, and inspection.

*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Elastic Limit:** While strong, steel also has an elastic limit. If the stress exceeds this limit, the cable will experience permanent deformation, compromising its integrity.  Repeatedly exceeding the elastic limit will eventually lead to failure.
    *   **Weight:** Steel is a dense material, leading to heavier cables. This increased weight can add to the overall load on the crane structure and may require a more powerful crane motor.
    *   **Corrosion:** Steel is susceptible to corrosion, especially in outdoor environments. Corrosion weakens the cable and can lead to catastrophic failure. Regular inspection and maintenance (e.g., lubrication) are crucial to prevent this.

**Polymer Cable:**

*   **Advantages:**
    *   **High Elastic Limit:**  A polymer with a significantly higher elastic limit can withstand greater stress before undergoing permanent deformation compared to steel. This is a significant advantage because it provides a larger safety margin and reduces the risk of permanent damage from overloading.
    *   **Lighter Weight:** Polymers are generally much less dense than steel, resulting in lighter cables. This reduces the overall load on the crane, potentially allowing for a smaller, more energy-efficient crane design.
    *   **Corrosion Resistance:** Many polymers are inherently resistant to corrosion, reducing the need for frequent inspections and maintenance in corrosive environments.

*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Lower Young's Modulus:** The lower Young's modulus means the polymer cable will stretch more under load compared to steel.  This higher strain could make precise load control more difficult and potentially dangerous.  The operator would need to compensate for the stretching.
    *   **Creep:** Polymers can exhibit creep, which is a slow, continuous deformation under constant stress, even below the elastic limit. This could lead to a gradual lengthening of the cable over time, requiring adjustments or eventual replacement.
    *   **Temperature Sensitivity:** The mechanical properties of polymers can be more sensitive to temperature changes than those of steel.  High temperatures can significantly reduce their strength and stiffness.
    *   **Durability:** Depending on the specific polymer, durability against abrasion, UV radiation, and other environmental factors might be a concern compared to steel.

**Conclusion:**

The best choice depends on the specific requirements of the crane and the operating environment.

*   **If precise load control and minimal deformation are paramount:** Steel is likely the better choice, despite its weight and corrosion concerns. Regular inspection and maintenance are critical.

*   **If weight reduction and corrosion resistance are critical, and some degree of deformation can be tolerated:** The polymer option becomes more attractive. However, careful consideration must be given to the polymer's creep characteristics, temperature sensitivity, and overall durability. Thorough testing and a well-defined maintenance schedule are essential to ensure safety and reliability. Additionally, the crane's control system may need to be designed to compensate for the increased cable stretch.

In summary, while a polymer with a higher elastic limit *seems* advantageous, the lower Young's modulus poses significant challenges for crane applications. A careful engineering analysis, considering all factors, is essential before making a final decision.

3.  **Problem Solving with Extension:** A solid metal cube is submerged in a deep ocean. The cube has a side length of *x* meters, and the Bulk Modulus of the metal is *B*. If the density of seawater increases linearly with depth, derive an expression for the fractional change in the cube's volume at a depth *h* below the surface, assuming the pressure at the surface is atmospheric pressure *P₀*. Express your answer in terms of *B*, *h*, the density gradient of seawater *k* (where density = ρ₀ + kh, ρ₀ being the surface density), *x*, *g* (acceleration due to gravity), and *P₀*.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, incorporating clear explanations and a step-by-step approach.

**Answer:**

To determine the fractional change in the cube's volume at depth *h*, we need to follow these steps:

1.  **Determine the pressure at depth *h***: The pressure at a depth *h* in a fluid with varying density is given by integrating the hydrostatic pressure equation. Since the density of seawater increases linearly with depth as ρ = ρ₀ + *kh*, the pressure *P* at depth *h* is:

    P = P₀ + ∫₀ʰ (ρ₀ + k*y*)g dy
    P = P₀ + g[ρ₀y + (k/2)y²]₀ʰ
    P = P₀ + ρ₀gh + (1/2)kgh²

    Where:
    *   *P₀* is the atmospheric pressure at the surface.
    *   ρ₀ is the density of seawater at the surface.
    *   *k* is the density gradient (how much the density increases per unit depth).
    *   *g* is the acceleration due to gravity.
    *   *h* is the depth.

2.  **Calculate the Hydraulic Stress:**  The hydraulic stress is the difference between the pressure at depth *h* and the pressure at the surface (*P₀*).

    Hydraulic Stress = P - P₀ = ρ₀gh + (1/2)kgh²

3.  **Apply the Definition of Bulk Modulus:** The Bulk Modulus (*B*) relates hydraulic stress to volumetric strain (fractional change in volume). The formula is:

    B = - (Hydraulic Stress) / (ΔV/V)

    Where:
    *   *B* is the Bulk Modulus of the metal cube.
    *   ΔV is the change in volume.
    *   V is the original volume.
    *  The negative sign indicates that an increase in pressure leads to a decrease in volume.

4.  **Solve for the Fractional Change in Volume (ΔV/V):** Rearranging the Bulk Modulus equation to solve for ΔV/V, we get:

    ΔV/V = - (Hydraulic Stress) / B
    ΔV/V = - (ρ₀gh + (1/2)kgh²) / B

**Therefore, the expression for the fractional change in the cube's volume at depth *h* is:**

**ΔV/V = - (ρ₀gh + (1/2)kgh²) / B**

**Explanation of the terms in the final expression:**

*   **- (negative sign):** Indicates that the volume decreases as the pressure increases.
*   **ρ₀gh:** This term represents the pressure increase due to the initial density of seawater (ρ₀).
*   **(1/2)kgh²:** This term represents the additional pressure increase due to the linearly increasing density of seawater.  The *h²* term arises from the integration of the density gradient over depth.
*   **B:**  The Bulk Modulus of the metal; a higher *B* means the material is more resistant to compression, resulting in a smaller fractional change in volume.

**Important Considerations for the Student:**

*   **Assumptions:** This derivation assumes that the Bulk Modulus (*B*) remains constant with pressure. In reality, *B* can also change at extremely high pressures. We also assume the compression is uniform.
*   **Units:** Ensure all units are consistent (SI units are recommended).
*   **Approximation:** This is an approximation, as it doesn't account for other potential effects like temperature changes with depth.
*   **Understanding:** Focus on understanding the *meaning* of each term and how they relate to the physical situation.  Don't just memorize the formula.  Consider what happens to the change in volume if you increase the depth, increase the density gradient, or use a material with a higher Bulk Modulus.
