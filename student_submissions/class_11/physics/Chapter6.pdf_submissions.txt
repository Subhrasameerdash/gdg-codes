Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, designed for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided chapter content hints:

**Answer:**

Let's analyze the motion of the thin, uniform rod of length *L* and mass *M* when a force *F* is applied perpendicularly at one end. We need to consider both its translational and rotational aspects.

**1. Translational Motion (Center of Mass):**

*   The force *F* acts on the rod, causing it to accelerate.  Since *F* is the net external force, and the rod has mass *M*, we can apply Newton's Second Law to the *center of mass* of the rod:

    *F = M a<sub>CM</sub>*

    where *a<sub>CM</sub>* is the acceleration of the center of mass.
*   Therefore, the acceleration of the center of mass is:

    *a<sub>CM</sub> = F/M*
*   Since the rod is initially at rest, its initial velocity, *v<sub>0,CM</sub>* = 0.  Using kinematics, we can find the position of the center of mass, *x<sub>CM</sub>*, as a function of time:

    *x<sub>CM</sub> = x<sub>0,CM</sub> + v<sub>0,CM</sub> t + (1/2) a<sub>CM</sub> t<sup>2</sup>*

    Where x<sub>0,CM</sub> is the initial position of centre of mass. Assuming the rod starts at the origin (x<sub>0,CM</sub> = 0):

    *x<sub>CM</sub> = (1/2) (F/M) t<sup>2</sup>*

    This equation describes the linear displacement of the center of mass as a function of time.  It moves with constant acceleration *F/M*.

**2. Rotational Motion:**

*   The force *F* applied at one end of the rod creates a torque about the center of mass. The magnitude of the torque, *τ*, is given by:

    *τ = rF sinθ*

    Since *F* is applied perpendicularly to the rod, θ = 90 degrees, and sinθ = 1.  The distance *r* from the center of mass to the point where the force is applied is *L/2*.  Therefore:

    *τ = (L/2) F*
*   Now, we need to relate this torque to the angular acceleration, *α*, of the rod. We use the rotational analog of Newton's Second Law:

    *τ = I α*

    where *I* is the moment of inertia of the rod about its center of mass.  For a thin, uniform rod rotating about an axis perpendicular to its length and passing through its center, the moment of inertia is:

    *I = (1/12) M L<sup>2</sup>*
*   Substituting the expressions for *τ* and *I*, we get:

    *(L/2) F = (1/12) M L<sup>2</sup> α*
*   Solving for the angular acceleration, *α*:

    *α = (6F) / (ML)*

    This is a constant angular acceleration.
*   Since the rod is initially at rest, its initial angular velocity, *ω<sub>0</sub>* = 0.  We can find the angular displacement, *θ*, as a function of time using kinematics:

    *θ = θ<sub>0</sub> + ω<sub>0</sub> t + (1/2) α t<sup>2</sup>*

    Assuming initial angular displacement θ<sub>0</sub> = 0:

    *θ = (1/2) α t<sup>2</sup> = (1/2) (6F / ML) t<sup>2</sup> = (3F / ML) t<sup>2</sup>*

    This equation describes the angular displacement of the rod as a function of time.

**In Summary:**

The thin rod, under the influence of the force *F*, undergoes both translational and rotational motion.

*   **Position of Center of Mass:** *x<sub>CM</sub> = (1/2) (F/M) t<sup>2</sup>*
*   **Angular Displacement:** *θ = (3F / ML) t<sup>2</sup>*

These equations describe the evolution of the rod's motion over time. The center of mass accelerates linearly, and the rod rotates with constant angular acceleration around its center of mass.

2.  Imagine designing a seesaw. You have two children of unequal masses, *m1* and *m2* (where *m1* > *m2*). The seesaw itself has a mass *M* and a length *L*, pivoting at its center. How would you strategically position the two children on either side of the pivot point to achieve perfect balance (i.e., maintain static equilibrium)? Clearly explain your reasoning and provide a mathematical solution for the distances from the pivot point.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11 or 12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content (which, frankly, isn't very helpful beyond knowing it's about rigid body dynamics, centre of mass, and torque).  The answer assumes the student has a basic understanding of these concepts.

**Answer:**

To design a balanced seesaw with children of unequal masses (m1 > m2) and a seesaw of mass M and length L, we need to ensure the net torque about the pivot point is zero. This guarantees static equilibrium, meaning the seesaw won't rotate. The pivot point is assumed to be at the center of the seesaw.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Forces Involved:** We have three forces contributing to the torque:
    *   The weight of the heavier child (m1g) acting downwards at a distance x1 from the pivot.
    *   The weight of the lighter child (m2g) acting downwards at a distance x2 from the pivot (on the opposite side).
    *   The weight of the seesaw (Mg) acting downwards at the center of the seesaw. Because the pivot is at the center, the weight of the seesaw will not produce torque around the pivot point.

2.  **Torque Definition:** Torque (τ) is the rotational equivalent of force and is calculated as τ = rFsinθ, where r is the distance from the pivot point to the point where the force is applied, F is the force, and θ is the angle between r and F. In our case, the force is gravity (acting downwards), and the seesaw is horizontal, so the angle is 90 degrees, and sin(90°) = 1.  Therefore, τ = rF.

3.  **Clockwise and Counter-Clockwise Torques:** We need to balance the clockwise and counter-clockwise torques. Let's assume the heavier child (m1) sits on the left side of the pivot, creating a clockwise torque, and the lighter child (m2) sits on the right side, creating a counter-clockwise torque.

4.  **Condition for Equilibrium:** For the seesaw to be balanced, the total torque must be zero:

    Clockwise Torque - Counter-Clockwise Torque = 0

**Mathematical Solution:**

Let:

*   *x1* be the distance of the heavier child (m1) from the pivot point.
*   *x2* be the distance of the lighter child (m2) from the pivot point.
*   *g* be the acceleration due to gravity.

Then:

*   Clockwise Torque = m1 * g * x1
*   Counter-Clockwise Torque = m2 * g * x2

For equilibrium:

m1 * g * x1 = m2 * g * x2

We can cancel out *g* from both sides:

m1 * x1 = m2 * x2

Therefore, the relationship between the distances is:

**x1 = (m2 / m1) * x2**

This equation tells us that the heavier child (m1) must sit closer to the pivot point than the lighter child (m2) to achieve balance.  To use this equation in practice:

1.  **Choose a Position for One Child:** Decide how far you want the lighter child (m2) to sit from the pivot (i.e., choose a value for *x2*).  Note that *x2* must be less than L/2.
2.  **Calculate the Other Child's Position:**  Use the equation above to calculate the required distance *x1* for the heavier child. Note that *x1* must be less than L/2.

**Conclusion:**

By strategically positioning the children according to the derived equation *x1 = (m2 / m1) * x2*, we can achieve a balanced seesaw, ensuring static equilibrium and a fun, stable ride! We can choose any position for one child and calculate the corresponding position of the other child to keep the seesaw balanced. Make sure the placement follows the limitations of the seesaw size. The weight of the seesaw doesn't need to be considered as long as the pivot point is at the centre of mass of the seesaw.

3.  A point mass *m* is moving with a constant velocity *v* along a straight line that does not pass through the origin. Without performing integration, explain how the angular momentum of the mass about the origin changes with time. Describe the vector direction and magnitude change, if any, of the angular momentum, providing a conceptual argument.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the given question based on the provided NCERT chapter content:

**Answer:**

The angular momentum of a point mass *m* moving with constant velocity *v* along a straight line (that doesn't pass through the origin) *does* change with time, even though the velocity is constant. Here's why:

**Understanding Angular Momentum**

Angular momentum (L) is defined as **L = r x p**, where:

*   **r** is the position vector from the origin to the point mass.
*   **p = mv** is the linear momentum of the point mass.
*   'x' represents the vector (or cross) product.

The magnitude of the angular momentum is given by  **|L| = rpsinθ**, where θ is the angle between the position vector **r** and the momentum vector **p**.

**Conceptual Argument:**

1.  **Changing Position Vector (r):** As the point mass moves along the straight line, its position vector **r** with respect to the origin continuously changes. Even though *v* is constant, the distance between the mass and the origin changes as well as the angle θ changes.

2.  **Vector Direction:** The direction of the angular momentum **L** is perpendicular to both **r** and **p**, following the right-hand rule. Since the point mass is constrained to move along a straight line, and assuming the origin is *not* on that line, the plane formed by **r** and **p** remains the same throughout the motion. Thus, the **direction** of the angular momentum vector **L** remains constant. It always points along the same axis (either into or out of the page, depending on the direction of motion relative to the origin's position).

3.  **Magnitude Change:** Although the direction of L remains constant, the *magnitude* of the angular momentum **|L| = rpsinθ** *does* change with time. While *m* and *v* are constant, the values of *r* and *sinθ* change as the particle moves along the line:
    *Initially, as the mass approaches its closest point to the origin, *r* decreases, and *sinθ* approaches 1. Thus |L| initially decreases.
    *When the mass is nearest the origin, the value of *rsinθ* is minimized. |L| is minimum at this point.
    *Finally, as the mass moves away from its closest point to the origin, *r* increases, and *sinθ* decreases. However, the combination of rsinθ increases and thus |L| increases.*

**In summary:**

*   The **direction** of the angular momentum remains constant.
*   The **magnitude** of the angular momentum initially decreases, reaches a minimum value at the point closest to the origin, and then increases as the mass moves away.
