Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, drawing upon the provided (though limited) NCERT chapter content and general physics knowledge:

**Answer:**

The metalworker uses the principle of thermal expansion to fit an iron ring onto a wooden wheel. Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to changes in temperature.  In this case, the metalworker uses *thermal expansion* to slightly *increase* the size of the iron ring so it can slip over the wooden wheel.

Here's the process:

1.  **Heating the Ring:** The metalworker heats the iron ring.  As the temperature of the iron ring increases, the iron atoms vibrate more vigorously. This increased vibration causes them to move slightly further apart, resulting in an overall expansion of the ring's diameter.

2.  **Fitting the Ring:**  Once the ring has expanded sufficiently, the metalworker quickly places it over the wooden wheel.

3.  **Cooling and Contraction:**  As the iron ring cools, it contracts (shrinks) back to its original size (or slightly smaller). This contraction creates a tight fit between the iron ring and the wooden wheel. The shrinking force of the ring provides the necessary grip.

**Factors determining the required temperature change:**

The amount the ring's temperature needs to be changed depends on several factors:

*   **The Initial Diameter Difference:**  The primary factor is the difference between the initial diameter of the ring and the diameter of the wooden wheel. The larger the difference (the tighter the intended fit), the more the ring needs to be expanded, and therefore, the higher the temperature increase required. The calculation would be based on ensuring the ring expands by at least the difference in these diameters.

*   **The Coefficient of Linear Expansion of Iron (α):**  Different materials expand at different rates for the same temperature change. Iron has a specific coefficient of linear expansion (α). This value represents the fractional change in length (or diameter, in this case) per degree Celsius (or Kelvin) change in temperature.  A higher coefficient of linear expansion means the material expands more for a given temperature change. The formula linking these is:

    ΔL = α * L₀ * ΔT

    Where:
    * ΔL is the change in diameter (expansion)
    * α is the coefficient of linear expansion of iron.
    * L₀ is the original diameter of the ring.
    * ΔT is the change in temperature.

    Therefore, to determine the required ΔT:   ΔT = ΔL / (α * L₀)

*   **The Original Diameter of the Ring (L₀):**  The larger the original diameter of the ring, the greater the absolute expansion will be for the same temperature change and coefficient of linear expansion. This is evident in the formula above.

*   **The Desired "Tightness" of the Fit:** The metalworker needs to consider how tightly the ring needs to grip the wheel. A looser fit requires less expansion (and a smaller temperature change), while a tighter fit requires more expansion (and a larger temperature change). This is linked directly to how much *smaller* than the wooden wheel's diameter the *unheated* ring is made.

*   **Working Temperature Limits:** The metalworker also needs to consider the temperature limits of the materials involved. Excessive heating of the iron ring might weaken it. Also, too much heat transferred to the wooden wheel could damage or ignite the wood.

In summary, the metalworker needs to carefully calculate the required temperature change, considering the dimensions of the ring and wheel, the properties of iron, and the desired tightness of the fit, while staying within safe temperature limits.

2.  A thermally insulated container holds ice and water in equilibrium at 0°C. If a known amount of heat is added to the system, describe the processes that occur and how you would calculate the final composition of the mixture (i.e., the final masses of ice and water), assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, geared towards a CBSE class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content summary.

**Answer:**

When a known amount of heat is added to a thermally insulated container holding ice and water in equilibrium at 0°C, the following processes occur:

1.  **Melting of Ice:** The added heat first goes into melting the ice present in the mixture. Since the initial temperature is 0°C (the melting point of ice), the temperature will *not* increase until *all* the ice has melted. This process occurs at a constant temperature (0°C). This is a phase change from solid to liquid.

2.  **Possible Temperature Increase (if ice completely melts):** If the amount of heat added is sufficient to melt *all* the ice, any *additional* heat will then go into raising the temperature of the *resulting* water.

**Calculating the Final Composition:**

To determine the final composition (masses of ice and water), we need to use the concept of latent heat of fusion. The latent heat of fusion (L) is the amount of heat required to change 1 kg of a substance from solid to liquid (or vice versa) *without* a change in temperature. For water, the latent heat of fusion (L<sub>f</sub>) is approximately 3.33 x 10<sup>5</sup> J/kg.

Here's a step-by-step approach to calculate the final masses of ice and water:

1.  **Determine the heat required to melt all the ice:**
    *   Let *m<sub>ice</sub>* be the initial mass of ice in the container (in kg).
    *   The heat required to melt all the ice, *Q<sub>melt</sub>*, is given by:
        *Q<sub>melt</sub> = m<sub>ice</sub> * L<sub>f</sub>*

2.  **Compare the added heat (Q<sub>added</sub>) with the heat required to melt all the ice (Q<sub>melt</sub>):**

    *   **Case 1: Q<sub>added</sub> < Q<sub>melt</sub>:** This means not all the ice will melt.
        *   Let *m<sub>melted</sub>* be the mass of ice that melts.  Then, *Q<sub>added</sub> = m<sub>melted</sub> * L<sub>f</sub>*
        *   Solve for *m<sub>melted</sub>*:  *m<sub>melted</sub> = Q<sub>added</sub> / L<sub>f</sub>*
        *   The final mass of ice will be:  *m<sub>ice_final</sub> = m<sub>ice</sub> - m<sub>melted</sub>*
        *   The final mass of water will be: *m<sub>water_final</sub> = m<sub>water_initial</sub> + m<sub>melted</sub>*  (where m<sub>water_initial</sub> is the initial mass of water).
        *   The final temperature will remain at 0°C.

    *   **Case 2: Q<sub>added</sub> = Q<sub>melt</sub>:** This means all the ice melts, and the final temperature is still 0°C.
        *   *m<sub>ice_final</sub> = 0*
        *   *m<sub>water_final</sub> = m<sub>water_initial</sub> + m<sub>ice</sub>*
        *   The final temperature will remain at 0°C.

    *   **Case 3: Q<sub>added</sub> > Q<sub>melt</sub>:** This means all the ice melts, and the remaining heat will increase the temperature of the water.
        *   First, all the ice melts: *m<sub>ice_final</sub> = 0* and *m<sub>water</sub> = m<sub>water_initial</sub> + m<sub>ice</sub>*
        *   The excess heat, *Q<sub>excess</sub>*, is: *Q<sub>excess</sub> = Q<sub>added</sub> - Q<sub>melt</sub>*
        *   Now, use the specific heat capacity of water (c<sub>water</sub> ≈ 4200 J/kg·K) to find the final temperature (T<sub>final</sub>).
        *   *Q<sub>excess</sub> = m<sub>water</sub> * c<sub>water</sub> * (T<sub>final</sub> - 0)*  (where the initial temperature is 0°C).
        *   Solve for *T<sub>final</sub>*: *T<sub>final</sub> = Q<sub>excess</sub> / (m<sub>water</sub> * c<sub>water</sub>)*

**In summary:**

The process involves using the latent heat of fusion to determine how much ice melts. By comparing the added heat with the heat required to melt all the ice, we can determine the final masses of ice and water. If there is excess heat after all the ice melts, it will raise the temperature of the water, which can be calculated using the specific heat capacity of water. The key assumption is that the container is perfectly insulated, so no heat is lost to the surroundings.

3.  Consider a scenario where heat transfer is occurring from a hot object to its surroundings primarily through natural convection. Explain the mechanism of natural convection and describe the key factors that influence the rate of heat transfer in this situation. How would increasing the surface area of the hot object affect the rate of heat transfer, and why?
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, drawing upon the (admittedly limited) content provided from the NCERT chapter.  I will make some assumptions and draw on general knowledge to provide a comprehensive answer.

**Answer:**

Natural convection is a process of heat transfer where fluid motion is driven by density differences caused by temperature variations within the fluid. In our scenario of a hot object transferring heat to its surroundings, the following happens:

1.  **Heating the Air:** The hot object heats the air immediately surrounding it.

2.  **Density Decrease:** As the air is heated, its temperature increases. According to the ideal gas law (and real-world observation), warmer air is less dense than cooler air.

3.  **Buoyancy:** The less dense, warmer air becomes buoyant and rises due to the upward force of buoyancy.

4.  **Displacement and Circulation:** As the warm air rises, cooler, denser air from the surroundings flows in to replace it, creating a continuous circulation pattern. This movement of the air carries heat away from the hot object. This circulating current is called convection current.

**Key Factors Influencing the Rate of Heat Transfer in Natural Convection:**

Several factors determine how quickly heat is transferred by natural convection:

*   **Temperature Difference (ΔT):** The greater the temperature difference between the hot object and the surrounding air, the faster the heat transfer. A larger ΔT leads to a greater density difference and therefore a stronger convective flow.

*   **Gravity (g):** Gravity is the driving force behind buoyancy. Stronger gravitational fields will lead to more vigorous convection.

*   **Fluid Properties:** Properties of the air (or whatever fluid is present) such as its density (ρ), viscosity (η), thermal conductivity (k), and specific heat capacity (c) influence convection.  Denser fluids or fluids with higher thermal conductivity will generally result in higher rates of convection.

*   **Geometry of the Object:** The shape and orientation of the hot object influence the flow patterns of the air around it.  For example, a horizontal surface facing upwards will typically have more effective heat transfer than a horizontal surface facing downwards.

**Effect of Increasing Surface Area:**

Increasing the surface area of the hot object will *significantly increase* the rate of heat transfer by natural convection.  Here's why:

*   **More Contact with Air:** A larger surface area provides more contact between the hot object and the surrounding air. This allows a greater volume of air to be heated simultaneously.

*   **Increased Convection Currents:** With more air being heated, stronger convection currents are generated. This leads to more efficient removal of heat from the object.

In essence, by increasing the surface area, you increase the area available for heat exchange with the air, thus promoting a more rapid and efficient convection process. Think of a radiator. Its design incorporates fins specifically to increase the surface area and enhance heat transfer by convection.
