1.  A student measures the side of a cube with a measuring instrument and records it as 3.00 x 10<sup>-3</sup> m. If the mass of the cube is known to be 2 g, calculate the density of the cube, paying close attention to significant figures in your final answer. Explain the rule applied for retaining significant figures during your calculation.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:

**Answer:**

To calculate the density of the cube, we'll use the following formula:

Density (ρ) = Mass (m) / Volume (V)

**1. Determine the Volume of the Cube:**

*   The side of the cube (l) is given as 3.00 x 10<sup>-3</sup> m.
*   The volume of a cube is calculated as V = l<sup>3</sup>
*   Therefore, V = (3.00 x 10<sup>-3</sup> m)<sup>3</sup> = 27.0 x 10<sup>-9</sup> m<sup>3</sup>

**2. Convert the Mass to SI Units:**

*   The mass of the cube (m) is given as 2 g.
*   To convert grams to kilograms, we divide by 1000:  m = 2 g = 2/1000 kg = 2 x 10<sup>-3</sup> kg

**3. Calculate the Density:**

*   Now we can calculate the density: ρ = m / V
*   ρ = (2 x 10<sup>-3</sup> kg) / (27.0 x 10<sup>-9</sup> m<sup>3</sup>) = 0.074074 x 10<sup>6</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> = 7.4074 x 10<sup>4</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>

**4. Apply Significant Figures Rule:**

*   In multiplication and division, the final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the *least* number of significant figures.
*   The mass (2 g or 2 x 10<sup>-3</sup> kg) has only *one* significant figure.
*   The side of the cube (3.00 x 10<sup>-3</sup> m) has *three* significant figures.
*   Therefore, our final answer must be rounded to one significant figure.

**5. Final Answer with Correct Significant Figures:**

*   Rounding 7.4074 x 10<sup>4</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> to one significant figure, we get:

    ρ = 7 x 10<sup>4</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>

**Therefore, the density of the cube is approximately 7 x 10<sup>4</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>.**

2.  The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by KE = (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup>. Discuss the significance of this formula in relating mass (m) and velocity (v) to energy. Also, explain how this formula can be used to define the SI unit of energy.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided (limited) NCERT chapter content:

**Answer:**

The kinetic energy (KE) formula, KE = (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup>, is fundamental in physics because it directly links an object's mass (m) and velocity (v) to its kinetic energy. Let's break down the significance:

*   **Relationship between Mass, Velocity, and Energy:**  The formula states that kinetic energy is directly proportional to the mass of the object and the *square* of its velocity. This means:

    *   **Mass (m):**  If we double the mass of an object while keeping its velocity constant, its kinetic energy will also double.  A heavier object, moving at the same speed as a lighter object, possesses more kinetic energy.
    *   **Velocity (v):** The effect of velocity is much more pronounced. If we double the velocity of an object while keeping its mass constant, its kinetic energy will *quadruple* (increase by a factor of 4). This is because kinetic energy depends on the square of the velocity.  Even a small increase in velocity can significantly increase an object's kinetic energy.

*   **Defining the SI Unit of Energy (Joule):** The KE formula provides a basis for defining the SI unit of energy, which is the Joule (J). According to the formula, energy is calculated using mass (kg) and velocity (m/s).
     Therefore:
        If m = 1 kg and v = 1 m/s, then
        KE = (1/2) * 1 kg * (1 m/s)<sup>2</sup> = 1/2 kg m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>
    Since energy is defined in Joules (J), 1 Joule is equal to 1 kg m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>
    1 J = 1 kg m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>.

In simple terms, one Joule is the amount of energy possessed by a 1 kg mass moving at a speed of 1 m/s

In conclusion, the kinetic energy formula effectively demonstrates how an object's motion (velocity) and inertia (mass) contribute to its energy, and it serves as a foundation for defining the standard unit of energy in physics.

3.  Explain how the rules for significant figures in addition and subtraction differ from the rules for significant figures in multiplication and division, with examples.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer explaining the difference in significant figure rules for addition/subtraction and multiplication/division, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:

The rules for determining significant figures in the results of addition/subtraction and multiplication/division operations differ significantly, focusing on different aspects of the numbers involved.

**Addition and Subtraction:**

In addition and subtraction, the **precision** (decimal places) of the numbers being added or subtracted is crucial.  The result should be rounded to the least precise number involved in the calculation.  In other words, the answer should have the same number of decimal places as the number with the *fewest* decimal places.

**Example:**

Let's say we add the following numbers:

*   2.51 (two decimal places)
*   1.3   (one decimal place)
*   4.002 (three decimal places)

Adding them gives us 2.51 + 1.3 + 4.002 = 7.812

However, since the number *1.3* has only one decimal place, our final answer must also have only one decimal place.  Therefore, we round 7.812 to **7.8**.

**Multiplication and Division:**

In multiplication and division, we focus on the **number of significant figures** in the numbers being multiplied or divided. The result should be rounded to the same number of significant figures as the number with the *least* number of significant figures.

**Example:**

Let's say we divide the following numbers:

*   2.5  (two significant figures)
*   1.345 (four significant figures)

Dividing them gives us 2.5 / 1.345 = 1.858736...

Since the number *2.5* has only two significant figures, our final answer must also have only two significant figures. Therefore, we round 1.858736... to **1.9**.

**Summary Table:**

| Operation             | Rule                                                                   | Focus        |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Addition/Subtraction | Round to the least number of decimal places.                            | Precision    |
| Multiplication/Division| Round to the least number of significant figures.                         | Significant Figures |

**In essence:**

*   **Addition/Subtraction is about how accurately you know the position of the decimal point.** You can't know the answer more accurately than your least accurate measurement.
*   **Multiplication/Division is about the relative uncertainty of the values.** You can't have a percentage uncertainty in the result that is less than the percentage uncertainty in the least certain factor.

Understanding these rules is critical for reporting results of calculations in scientific contexts accurately, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in the measurements used.
