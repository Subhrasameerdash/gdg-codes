1.  A sealed container of fixed volume holds a mixture of two ideal gases, Gas A and Gas B. If the number of moles of Gas A is doubled while the total pressure remains constant, explain how the mean free path of Gas B changes. Justify your answer by relating it to the relevant molecular properties and the number of molecules present.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the assignment question based on the provided NCERT chapter content (though the content is limited, I'll make reasonable assumptions and focus on the relationship between moles, pressure, and mean free path):

**Answer:**

Let's analyze how the mean free path of Gas B changes when the amount of Gas A is doubled in a sealed container of fixed volume, while maintaining a constant total pressure.

**Understanding the Concepts**

*   **Mean Free Path (λ):** The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It's inversely proportional to the number density (number of molecules per unit volume) and the collision cross-section (related to the size of the molecules).  A simplified way to think about it is: λ ∝ 1/(nσ), where 'n' is the number density and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.

*   **Ideal Gas Law:** PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the total number of moles of gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature.

*   **Partial Pressures:** In a mixture of ideal gases, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas (Dalton's Law): P<sub>total</sub> = P<sub>A</sub> + P<sub>B</sub>.  The partial pressure of each gas is proportional to its mole fraction: P<sub>A</sub> = (n<sub>A</sub>/n<sub>total</sub>) * P<sub>total</sub>

**The Scenario:**

We have a fixed volume (V) and constant total pressure (P<sub>total</sub>). Initially, let's say we have n<sub>A1</sub> moles of Gas A and n<sub>B</sub> moles of Gas B. Then, the number of moles of Gas A is doubled, becoming n<sub>A2</sub> = 2n<sub>A1</sub>, while the total pressure remains constant.  Since the total pressure is constant, the number of moles of Gas B must decrease.

**Applying the Concepts**

1.  **Constant Total Pressure:** Since P<sub>total</sub> is constant, according to the Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT), and since V and T are fixed, the *total* number of moles of gas (n<sub>total</sub> = n<sub>A</sub> + n<sub>B</sub>) must also remain constant.

2.  **Change in Moles of Gas B:** If n<sub>A</sub> increases to 2n<sub>A1</sub>, and n<sub>A</sub> + n<sub>B</sub> must remain constant, then the number of moles of Gas B, n<sub>B</sub>, *must decrease*. Let the new number of moles of Gas B be n'<sub>B</sub>. Therefore, we must have: 2n<sub>A1</sub> + n'<sub>B</sub> = n<sub>A1</sub> + n<sub>B</sub> which means that n'<sub>B</sub> = n<sub>B</sub> - n<sub>A1</sub>

3.  **Effect on Mean Free Path of Gas B:** The mean free path of Gas B is affected by the number density of *all* the gas molecules present, not just Gas B. Because the total number of moles remains constant (n<sub>A</sub> + n<sub>B</sub>), the number density of all gas molecules remains constant.
    Therefore, because the total number density remains constant, the mean free path of Gas B does not change.

**Conclusion:**

Because the total pressure and volume are constant, the total number density does not change. Therefore the mean free path of Gas B does not change.

**Important Considerations for a Higher Grade:**

*   **Collision Cross-Section:**  A more advanced answer could acknowledge the collision cross-section (σ).  The type of collision (A-A, B-B, or A-B) would ideally be considered. Because the composition of gases changes, this could have a very small effect on the overall mean free path but, because the question asks for the mean free path of Gas B, this effect would be on the order of collision cross-sections between A and B, and between B and B.
*   **Temperature:** The problem assumes constant temperature. If temperature were to change, it would affect the average speed of the molecules and, consequently, the collision frequency and mean free path.

2.  Water's density at a specific temperature is known. Using Avogadro's number and relevant assumptions about the liquid state, design a step-by-step method to estimate the average spacing between water molecules. Explain each step and state any assumptions made.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a step-by-step method to estimate the average spacing between water molecules, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, using Avogadro's number and the density of water, along with explanations and assumptions:

**Answer:**

To estimate the average spacing between water molecules, we'll use the density of water, Avogadro's number, and make some reasonable assumptions about the liquid state. Here's the step-by-step method:

**1. Understand the Given Information:**

*   **Density of Water (ρ):**  We are given that the density of water is 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. It's crucial to remember that this density is at a specific temperature (usually around 4°C).
*   **Avogadro's Number (N<sub>A</sub>):** This is a fundamental constant representing the number of molecules in one mole of a substance: N<sub>A</sub> ≈ 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules/mol.
*   **Molar Mass of Water (M):** The molar mass of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is approximately 18 g/mol or 0.018 kg/mol. This is calculated by summing the atomic masses of two hydrogen atoms (approximately 1 g/mol each) and one oxygen atom (approximately 16 g/mol).

**2. Calculate the Number of Moles per Unit Volume:**

*   We want to find how many moles of water are present in a given volume (1 m<sup>3</sup> in this case).  We can use the density to convert volume to mass, and then molar mass to convert mass to moles.
*   **Moles per cubic meter:**
    *   Moles/m<sup>3</sup> = (Density) / (Molar Mass)
    *   Moles/m<sup>3</sup> = (1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) / (0.018 kg/mol)
    *   Moles/m<sup>3</sup> ≈ 55555.56 mol/m<sup>3</sup>

**3. Calculate the Number of Molecules per Unit Volume:**

*   Now, we need to convert from moles per cubic meter to the number of water molecules per cubic meter. We use Avogadro's number for this conversion.
*   **Molecules per cubic meter (N):**
    *   N = (Moles/m<sup>3</sup>) * (Avogadro's Number)
    *   N ≈ (55555.56 mol/m<sup>3</sup>) * (6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules/mol)
    *   N ≈ 3.345 x 10<sup>28</sup> molecules/m<sup>3</sup>

**4.  Assume a Cubic Arrangement (Crucial Assumption):**

*   Here's a key assumption. We assume that the water molecules are arranged in a simple cubic lattice. This is a simplification, as water molecules in the liquid state are not perfectly ordered. However, it allows us to estimate the spacing.

**5. Calculate the Volume Occupied by a Single Molecule:**

*   If we know the number of molecules per unit volume, we can find the volume occupied by a single molecule.
*   **Volume per molecule (V<sub>molecule</sub>):**
    *   V<sub>molecule</sub> = 1 / N
    *   V<sub>molecule</sub> ≈ 1 / (3.345 x 10<sup>28</sup> molecules/m<sup>3</sup>)
    *   V<sub>molecule</sub> ≈ 2.99 x 10<sup>-29</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/molecule

**6. Calculate the Average Spacing (Distance Between Molecules):**

*   Since we assumed a cubic arrangement, the volume occupied by each molecule can be thought of as a cube. The side length of this cube represents the approximate distance between the centers of adjacent water molecules.
*   **Average spacing (d):**
    *   d = (V<sub>molecule</sub>)<sup>1/3</sup>  (cube root of the volume)
    *   d ≈ (2.99 x 10<sup>-29</sup> m<sup>3</sup>)<sup>1/3</sup>
    *   d ≈ 3.10 x 10<sup>-10</sup> m
    *   d ≈ 0.31 nm (nanometers)

**7. State the Result and Discuss Assumptions:**

*   Therefore, the estimated average spacing between water molecules is approximately 0.31 nm.

**Assumptions Made:**

*   **Density at a Specific Temperature:** We used the density of water (1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>), which is usually at around 4°C. The density changes with temperature, so the spacing will also change slightly.
*   **Simple Cubic Arrangement:** The most significant assumption is that water molecules are arranged in a simple cubic lattice. In reality, the structure of liquid water is more complex due to hydrogen bonding. This assumption leads to an *estimate* rather than an exact value. The actual structure is dynamic and involves tetrahedral coordination due to hydrogen bonds.
*   **Treating Molecules as Point Masses:** We are treating the water molecules as point masses occupying a certain volume. In reality, molecules have a more complex shape and electron distribution.

**Conclusion:**

This calculation provides a reasonable estimate for the average spacing between water molecules. Keep in mind that the assumptions made will affect the accuracy of the result. This exercise demonstrates how we can combine macroscopic properties like density with microscopic concepts like Avogadro's number to understand the behavior of matter at the molecular level. A more accurate determination would require considering the complex hydrogen bonding network in liquid water using advanced techniques like X-ray diffraction or neutron scattering.

3.  A sample of naturally occurring element X consists of two isotopes, X-235 and X-238, with different relative abundances. Given the atomic masses of each isotope and the overall atomic mass of element X, formulate an equation (or set of equations) to determine the percentage abundance of each isotope in the sample. Explain the physical significance of each term in your equation(s).
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:

**Answer:**

To determine the percentage abundance of the isotopes X-235 and X-238 in a naturally occurring sample of element X, we can formulate the following equation:

Let:

*   *A<sub>1</sub>* = Atomic mass of X-235 (approximately 235 u, where 'u' stands for atomic mass unit)
*   *A<sub>2</sub>* = Atomic mass of X-238 (approximately 238 u)
*   *A* = Overall atomic mass of element X (This value would be provided, typically in the periodic table, or in the problem statement)
*   *x* = Percentage abundance of X-235 (expressed as a decimal, e.g., 0.1 for 10%)
*   *(1-x)* = Percentage abundance of X-238 (expressed as a decimal).  Since the percentages of the two isotopes must add up to 100%, if *x* is the fractional abundance of X-235, then *1-x* is the fractional abundance of X-238.

The equation representing the weighted average of the isotopic masses is:

*A* = *x* *A<sub>1</sub>* + (1-*x*) *A<sub>2</sub>*

**Explanation of the terms and their physical significance:**

*   ***A<sub>1</sub> (Atomic mass of X-235):*** This represents the mass of a single atom of the isotope X-235. Isotopes have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, hence the different masses. The atomic mass is a physical property characteristic of this specific isotope.
*   ***A<sub>2</sub> (Atomic mass of X-238):*** This represents the mass of a single atom of the isotope X-238. It is a distinct physical property of this isotope, reflecting its unique neutron count.
*   ***A (Overall atomic mass of element X):*** This is the experimentally determined average atomic mass of the naturally occurring element X.  It's a weighted average that takes into account the relative amounts (abundances) of each isotope. This is the value you see on the periodic table.
*   ***x (Percentage abundance of X-235):*** This represents the fraction of all X atoms in the sample that are X-235.  Abundance reflects the probability of finding a particular isotope in a naturally occurring sample of the element.
*   ***(1-x) (Percentage abundance of X-238):*** This represents the fraction of all X atoms in the sample that are X-238. Since the sample consists *only* of X-235 and X-238, the sum of their fractional abundances must be 1.

**How to Solve:**

1.  You will be given *A*, *A<sub>1</sub>*, and *A<sub>2</sub>*.
2.  Substitute these values into the equation: *A* = *x* *A<sub>1</sub>* + (1-*x*) *A<sub>2</sub>*.
3.  Solve the equation for *x*. This will give you the fractional abundance of X-235.
4.  Calculate (1-*x*) to find the fractional abundance of X-238.
5.  Multiply *x* and (1-*x*) by 100 to express the abundances as percentages.

**In summary:** This equation allows us to relate the experimentally measurable overall atomic mass of an element to the individual atomic masses and relative amounts of its isotopes.  It's a direct application of the concept of a weighted average, where the "weights" are the isotopic abundances.  Understanding this equation provides insight into the composition of naturally occurring elements and the principles of isotopic analysis.
