1.  A block rests on an inclined plane. Describe how the forces acting on the block change as the angle of the incline is gradually increased. Include a discussion of static friction, kinetic friction (if motion occurs), and the conditions required for the block to begin sliding.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student based on the provided (limited) NCERT chapter content. It aims to be clear, concise, and incorporate relevant concepts (primarily friction) even though the context is incomplete.

**Answer:**

Let's consider a block of mass *m* resting on an inclined plane. As the angle of inclination, denoted by *θ*, increases, the forces acting on the block change, ultimately determining whether the block remains at rest or begins to slide.  The forces involved are:

1.  **Gravitational Force (Weight):**  This force, *mg*, acts vertically downwards. We can resolve this force into two components:
    *   *mg*cos(*θ*) : Perpendicular to the inclined plane.
    *   *mg*sin(*θ*) : Parallel to the inclined plane, acting downwards.

2.  **Normal Force (N):** This is the force exerted by the inclined plane on the block, perpendicular to the surface.  It balances the component of the gravitational force perpendicular to the plane. Initially, *N* = *mg*cos(*θ*). As *θ* increases, cos(*θ*) decreases, and thus the normal force *N* also decreases.

3.  **Static Friction (f<sub>s</sub>):** This force acts parallel to the inclined plane and opposes the component of gravity pulling the block downwards (*mg*sin(*θ*)).  Static friction is a self-adjusting force; it increases as *mg*sin(*θ*) increases, preventing the block from sliding as long as it can.  The magnitude of static friction is *f<sub>s</sub>* ≤ μ<sub>s</sub>*N*, where μ<sub>s</sub> is the coefficient of static friction between the block and the plane.

**Conditions for Sliding:**

The block will remain at rest as long as the static friction force can balance the component of gravity pulling it down the plane. This means:

*   *mg*sin(*θ*) ≤ μ<sub>s</sub>*N*
*   *mg*sin(*θ*) ≤ μ<sub>s</sub> *mg*cos(*θ*)
*   tan(*θ*) ≤ μ<sub>s</sub>

Therefore, the block will start to slide when the angle *θ* reaches a critical value, let's call it *θ<sub>max</sub>*, such that tan(*θ<sub>max</sub>*) = μ<sub>s</sub>.  *θ<sub>max</sub>* is often called the angle of repose or the angle of limiting friction.  At this angle, the component of gravity down the slope is just about to exceed the maximum static friction force.

**Kinetic Friction (f<sub>k</sub>):**

Once the block begins to slide (i.e., when *θ* > *θ<sub>max</sub>*), the friction force changes from static friction to kinetic friction. Kinetic friction opposes the motion of the block and is generally less than the maximum static friction force.  The magnitude of kinetic friction is *f<sub>k</sub>* = μ<sub>k</sub>*N*, where μ<sub>k</sub> is the coefficient of kinetic friction (and μ<sub>k</sub> < μ<sub>s</sub>).

In this case, the net force on the block down the incline will be *mg*sin(*θ*) - μ<sub>k</sub>*mg*cos(*θ*).  This net force causes the block to accelerate down the incline.  The acceleration can be calculated using Newton's Second Law: *a* = ( *mg*sin(*θ*) - μ<sub>k</sub>*mg*cos(*θ*) ) / *m*  =  *g*(sin(*θ*) - μ<sub>k</sub>cos(*θ*)).

**In Summary:**

As the angle of the incline increases:

*   The normal force decreases.
*   The component of gravity pulling the block down the incline (*mg*sin(*θ*)) increases.
*   The static friction force increases to match the increasing component of gravity, *up to a maximum value*.
*   Sliding begins when the angle exceeds the angle of repose (tan *θ* > μ<sub>s</sub>).
*   Once sliding begins, static friction is replaced by kinetic friction, and the block accelerates down the plane.

**Important Considerations (Based on Limited Chapter Content):**

*   The provided NCERT summary mentions solved examples about bullets fired from guns. While not directly related, these examples suggest understanding force application and resulting motion is important. The answer above relates the net force on the block (gravity minus friction) to its acceleration.
*   The summary mentions circular motion and cyclists. While also not directly applicable, it reinforces that the concepts of force and motion are intertwined, and the answer provided clearly links forces to the block's motion (or lack thereof).

2.  Two objects of different masses collide head-on. One object is initially at rest. Describe how you would determine the final velocities of each object after the collision, assuming the collision is perfectly elastic. Explain the role of the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy in your calculation.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student addressing the given assignment question, drawing upon the provided NCERT chapter context (though limited). I'll focus on being clear, concise, and relevant, even though the provided chapter content is very fragmented and doesn't provide specific formulas.

**Answer:**

To determine the final velocities of two objects of different masses involved in a perfectly elastic head-on collision where one object is initially at rest, we rely on the principles of conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy. Here's how we would approach the problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

*   Let `m1` be the mass of the first object (the one initially moving).
*   Let `m2` be the mass of the second object (initially at rest).
*   Let `v1i` be the initial velocity of the first object.
*   Let `v2i = 0` be the initial velocity of the second object (since it's at rest).
*   Let `v1f` be the final velocity of the first object after the collision.
*   Let `v2f` be the final velocity of the second object after the collision.

**2. Conservation of Momentum:**

In any collision (elastic or inelastic), the total momentum of the system is conserved. This means the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision. Mathematically:

`m1*v1i + m2*v2i = m1*v1f + m2*v2f`

Since `v2i = 0`, this simplifies to:

`m1*v1i = m1*v1f + m2*v2f`  (Equation 1)

**3. Conservation of Kinetic Energy:**

In a perfectly elastic collision, kinetic energy is also conserved. This means the total kinetic energy before the collision equals the total kinetic energy after the collision. Mathematically:

`(1/2)*m1*v1i^2 + (1/2)*m2*v2i^2 = (1/2)*m1*v1f^2 + (1/2)*m2*v2f^2`

Since `v2i = 0`, this simplifies to:

`(1/2)*m1*v1i^2 = (1/2)*m1*v1f^2 + (1/2)*m2*v2f^2`

Multiplying through by 2 to eliminate fractions:

`m1*v1i^2 = m1*v1f^2 + m2*v2f^2` (Equation 2)

**4. Solving the Equations:**

Now we have two equations (Equation 1 and Equation 2) with two unknowns (`v1f` and `v2f`). We can solve this system of equations simultaneously.  There are a couple of ways to do this, but a common method is:

*   Solve Equation 1 for one of the final velocities (e.g., solve for `v1f`):

    `v1f = (m1*v1i - m2*v2f) / m1`

*   Substitute this expression for `v1f` into Equation 2.  This will result in a single equation with only `v2f` as the unknown.
*   Solve the resulting (likely quadratic) equation for `v2f`.  You may need to use the quadratic formula.
*   Once you have `v2f`, substitute it back into either Equation 1 or the expression for `v1f` to find `v1f`.

**5. The Role of Conservation Laws:**

*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Ensures that the total "amount of motion" in the system remains constant.  Momentum is a vector quantity, so direction is crucial. It allows us to relate the initial and final velocities based on the masses involved.
*   **Conservation of Kinetic Energy:** This is the key characteristic of a *perfectly elastic* collision. It provides a second independent equation, which is essential to solve for the two unknown final velocities.  If the collision were inelastic, kinetic energy would not be conserved, and we would need additional information (like the coefficient of restitution) to solve the problem.

**In Summary:**

By applying the conservation of momentum and the conservation of kinetic energy, we can set up a system of equations that allows us to calculate the final velocities of the two objects after the perfectly elastic head-on collision. Solving these equations provides a complete description of the motion after the impact.

3.  A car travels around a banked circular track at a constant speed. Explain how the banking angle of the track contributes to the centripetal force required for the car to maintain its circular path. How does the optimal banking angle change as the speed of the car increases, and what happens if the car's speed deviates significantly from the designed speed for the banking?
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content (which is admittedly sparse, but we'll work with it):

**Answer:**

When a car travels around a banked circular track, the banking angle (θ) plays a crucial role in providing the necessary centripetal force to keep the car moving in a circle. Without banking, the centripetal force would solely rely on friction between the tires and the road. However, banking reduces the reliance on friction, making the turn safer and more efficient, especially at higher speeds.

Here's how the banking angle contributes:

*   **Components of Normal Force:** The normal force (N) exerted by the track on the car acts perpendicular to the surface of the track. This normal force can be resolved into two components:
    *   N cos θ: The vertical component, balancing the car's weight (mg).  So, N cos θ = mg.
    *   N sin θ: The horizontal component, providing the centripetal force (Fc) required for circular motion. So, N sin θ = mv<sup>2</sup>/r, where m is the mass of the car, v is its speed, and r is the radius of the circular track.

*   **Centripetal Force Equation:** By dividing the equation for the horizontal component (N sin θ = mv<sup>2</sup>/r) by the equation for the vertical component (N cos θ = mg), we get:

    tan θ = v<sup>2</sup>/rg

    This equation shows the relationship between the banking angle (θ), the car's speed (v), the radius of the track (r), and the acceleration due to gravity (g).

*   **Optimal Banking Angle and Speed:** The optimal banking angle is the angle at which the car can negotiate the curve *without* relying on friction.  This occurs when the horizontal component of the normal force provides exactly the required centripetal force. The equation tan θ = v<sup>2</sup>/rg allows us to calculate this optimal angle for a given speed and radius.

**How the Optimal Angle Changes with Speed:**

As the equation tan θ = v<sup>2</sup>/rg demonstrates, the optimal banking angle is directly proportional to the *square* of the car's speed (v<sup>2</sup>). This means:

*   If the car's speed *increases*, the optimal banking angle *also increases*. A steeper bank is needed to provide the larger centripetal force required for the higher speed.
*   Conversely, if the car's speed *decreases*, the optimal banking angle *decreases*. A less steep bank is sufficient at lower speeds.

**What Happens if the Speed Deviates Significantly:**

If the car's speed deviates significantly from the designed speed for the banking, the car will need to rely on friction to maintain its circular path:

*   **Speed Too High (v > v<sub>designed</sub>):** If the car travels faster than the designed speed, the horizontal component of the normal force (N sin θ) will not be sufficient to provide the necessary centripetal force. The car will tend to skid *up* the banking.  The frictional force will act *down* the banking to help provide the additional centripetal force.

*   **Speed Too Low (v < v<sub>designed</sub>):** If the car travels slower than the designed speed, the horizontal component of the normal force (N sin θ) will be *more* than sufficient to provide the centripetal force. The car will tend to slide *down* the banking.  The frictional force will act *up* the banking to reduce the centripetal force to the appropriate amount.

In extreme cases, if the speed deviation is too great and the available friction is insufficient, the car could either skid up the track and potentially out of the curve or slide down the track towards the inside, leading to a loss of control. Therefore, while banking significantly improves safety, drivers must still adjust their speed to the conditions and the designed banking angle.
