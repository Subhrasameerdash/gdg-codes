Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT content:

**Answer:**

The rapid root elongation observed in the plant species under drought conditions is a complex adaptive response that likely involves differentiation, dedifferentiation, and redifferentiation at the cellular level, mediated by plant growth regulators (PGRs). Here's a possible explanation of the processes involved:

1.  **Sensing the Drought and Signal Transduction:**

    *   When the plant experiences drought, it first needs to *sense* the stress. Specialized cells in the roots might act as sensors, detecting changes in soil moisture potential.
    *   This triggers a signaling cascade involving various molecules, eventually leading to changes in the levels and distribution of different PGRs.

2.  **Dedifferentiation for Cell Proliferation:**

    *   To achieve rapid root elongation, the plant needs to increase the number of cells in the root. This often involves *dedifferentiation* of some existing root cells.  For instance, certain parenchyma cells in the vascular cylinder or cortex might dedifferentiate. This means they revert from their specialized roles to a more meristematic (dividing) state. Dedifferentiation is necessary because fully differentiated cells typically lose their ability to divide.
    *   The PGRs that likely play a role in promoting dedifferentiation in this context are **cytokinins** and possibly **auxins**. Cytokinins are known to stimulate cell division, and Auxins may also play a role in initiating cell division in specific areas of the root.

3.  **Cell Division and Growth:**

    *   Once the cells have dedifferentiated, they can undergo rapid cell division, contributing to the overall growth of the root. This cell division happens primarily in the root apical meristem and in newly formed lateral root meristems.
    *   The PGRs involved here are again, prominently **cytokinins**, promoting cell division.

4.  **Differentiation and Redifferentiation for Root Function:**

    *   As new cells are produced, they need to *differentiate* into specialized cell types to perform the various functions of the root (water absorption, nutrient uptake, anchorage). This process is called *redifferentiation*.
    *   For example, some cells will differentiate into xylem elements for water transport, while others will become root hair cells to increase the surface area for water and nutrient absorption.
    *   The PGRs involved in redifferentiation are complex and depend on the specific cell type being formed. **Auxins** play a key role in vascular tissue differentiation. The balance between **auxins and cytokinins** is often crucial in determining the fate of differentiating cells. **Abscisic acid (ABA)**, a stress hormone, may also be involved in promoting the differentiation of cells involved in drought tolerance.

5.  **Role of Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**

    *   **Auxins:** Promote cell elongation, especially in the apical region of the root.  They also influence vascular tissue differentiation, ensuring proper water transport.
    *   **Cytokinins:** Stimulate cell division in the dedifferentiated cells, increasing the overall cell number.
    *   **Abscisic Acid (ABA):**  As a stress hormone, ABA levels typically increase during drought.  It can promote root growth while inhibiting shoot growth, helping the plant prioritize water uptake. It may also influence the differentiation of specific cell types involved in drought resistance.
    *   **Gibberellins:** While primarily known for stem elongation, gibberellins may play a role in root growth in some species, potentially by promoting cell division and elongation.
    *   **Ethylene:** Can also be produced under stress. It can affect root growth.

In summary, the plant's response to drought involves a carefully orchestrated sequence of dedifferentiation, cell division, and redifferentiation, all under the control of changing PGR levels. This allows the plant to rapidly extend its root system and access deeper water sources, increasing its chances of survival in arid conditions. The specific combination and concentrations of PGRs involved will vary depending on the plant species and the severity of the drought.

2.  Two groups of identical seedlings are grown under different photoperiods: Group A receives 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness, while Group B receives 8 hours of light and 16 hours of darkness. After several weeks, Group A flowers profusely, while Group B remains vegetative.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:

**Answer:**

The difference in flowering behavior between Group A and Group B seedlings is a classic example of **photoperiodism**. Photoperiodism is the developmental responses of plants to the relative lengths of light and dark periods (the photoperiod).  Plants use photoreceptors to detect the changes in day or night length. These photoreceptors include phytochromes and cryptochromes.

In this scenario:

*   **Group A (16 hours light/8 hours darkness):** This group flowers profusely, indicating that these plants are likely **long-day plants (LDPs)**, also sometimes referred to as short-night plants. Long-day plants require a photoperiod *exceeding* a critical length to initiate flowering. In other words, they need a longer period of light than darkness to trigger flowering. The 16-hour light period meets this requirement.

*   **Group B (8 hours light/16 hours darkness):** This group remains vegetative, suggesting that the photoperiod is not suitable for flowering. Since Group A flowered under long-day conditions, it's highly probable that Group B did not flower because it did not receive enough light.

**In conclusion, the observed difference in flowering is due to photoperiodism. The seedlings are likely long-day plants, requiring a longer day length (or shorter night length) than provided to Group B in order to initiate the flowering process.**

**Additional Points to Consider (for a more complete answer):**

*   **Critical Photoperiod:** Mentioning the concept of a "critical photoperiod" would further strengthen the answer. This is the specific day length that determines whether a plant will flower or not. For LDPs, the photoperiod must be *longer* than the critical photoperiod.
*   **Other factors:** While photoperiodism is the most likely explanation, briefly acknowledging that other environmental factors (temperature, nutrient availability, etc.) could also play a role (though less likely in this controlled experiment) demonstrates a more comprehensive understanding.
*   **Phytochromes:** Briefly mentioning the role of photoreceptors like phytochromes (which detect light) could add more depth.

3.  A botanist observes that applying a specific plant growth regulator to a plant stem results in a significant increase in stem length, but also a noticeable decrease in root development. Explain the potential reasons for this observation, considering the roles and interactions of different plant growth regulators. Discuss whether this observation represents a beneficial or detrimental effect on the plant and under which environmental condition.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, designed for a Class 11-12 CBSE student:

**Answer:**

The botanist's observation of increased stem length and decreased root development upon application of a plant growth regulator (PGR) highlights the complex and often interconnected roles of these chemical messengers in plant physiology. Several factors could contribute to this phenomenon:

**1. Likely PGR Involved: Gibberellins (GA):**

The most probable PGR causing this effect is a gibberellin. Gibberellins are well-known for promoting stem elongation. They do this by stimulating cell division and cell elongation in the stem. However, GA often exhibits an antagonistic relationship with root development. While promoting shoot growth, it can inhibit root initiation and elongation.

**2. Hormonal Interactions and Resource Allocation:**

Plant growth regulators don't act in isolation. They interact with each other in complex synergistic (enhancing) or antagonistic (opposing) ways. The application of a specific PGR can disrupt the delicate hormonal balance within the plant.

*   **Auxin:** While gibberellins are primarily responsible for stem elongation, auxins are crucial for root development. Auxins are transported basipetally (downwards) and promote cell division and differentiation in the root apical meristem, leading to root growth. The application of GA might interfere with auxin transport or signaling, leading to reduced root growth. It could also affect auxin biosynthesis in the roots themselves.

*   **Cytokinins:** These PGRs promote cell division and are often associated with shoot development. While they can sometimes promote root branching, an overabundance (perhaps triggered by the GA application's effect on cytokinin levels) might further shift resources away from root growth towards shoot growth.

Essentially, the plant is prioritizing stem growth at the expense of root growth. This happens because the plant has a limited amount of resources (sugars, nutrients, etc.). The hormonal signal caused by the applied PGR causes the plant to allocate more of these resources to stem elongation and less to root development.

**3. Beneficial or Detrimental Effect and Environmental Conditions:**

Whether this effect is beneficial or detrimental depends heavily on the plant species, its stage of development, and, most importantly, the environmental conditions:

*   **Potentially Beneficial:** In environments where the primary limiting factor is light availability, increased stem length could be advantageous. A taller stem allows the plant to outcompete neighboring plants for sunlight, increasing photosynthetic capacity. In waterlogged environments where the roots may not be as important, stem elongation may be useful.

*   **Potentially Detrimental:** In most other situations, the observed effect is likely detrimental. Reduced root development compromises the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients from the soil. This makes the plant more susceptible to:
    *   **Drought stress:** Smaller root system means less water uptake.
    *   **Nutrient deficiencies:** Limited root surface area restricts nutrient absorption.
    *   **Physical instability:** A poorly developed root system provides less anchorage, making the plant more prone to being uprooted by wind or heavy rain.

**In conclusion:** The observed increase in stem length at the expense of root development is likely due to the application of gibberellins, which disrupted the plant's hormonal balance and resource allocation. While it *could* be beneficial in specific, light-limited environments, it is generally detrimental, making the plant more vulnerable to environmental stresses due to impaired water and nutrient uptake. Therefore, careful consideration of the plant's needs and environmental conditions is crucial when using PGRs.
