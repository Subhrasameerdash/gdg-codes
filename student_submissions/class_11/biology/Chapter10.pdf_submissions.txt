Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, drawing upon the provided NCERT-based content:

**Question:** A scientist discovers a new chemical that disrupts the formation of the mitotic spindle. What effect would this chemical have on cell division, and why?

**Answer:**

The mitotic spindle is absolutely crucial for proper cell division during mitosis. It's a structure made of microtubules that's responsible for accurately separating the duplicated chromosomes (sister chromatids) and ensuring that each daughter cell receives a complete and identical set of genetic information. If a chemical disrupts the formation of the mitotic spindle, it will have significant and detrimental effects on cell division.

Here's a breakdown of the likely consequences:

1.  **Chromosomes Will Not Separate Properly (or at All):** The primary function of the mitotic spindle is to attach to the chromosomes at the centromere (specifically, at the kinetochore) and then pull the sister chromatids apart towards opposite poles of the cell. If the spindle doesn't form correctly, the chromosomes will likely remain clustered together. They won't be organized or segregated into two equal groups.

2.  **Arrest of Cell Division:** The cell has built-in checkpoints during the cell cycle to ensure that everything is proceeding correctly before it moves on to the next phase. One of these checkpoints monitors spindle formation and chromosome attachment. If the mitotic spindle is disrupted, this checkpoint will likely trigger a cell cycle arrest, preventing the cell from progressing into anaphase (the stage where sister chromatids separate). The cell cycle would halt, usually at metaphase.

3.  **Unequal Distribution of Chromosomes (Aneuploidy):** In some cases, if the spindle disruption is partial or if the cell somehow bypasses the checkpoints, the cell might attempt to divide anyway. However, without a functional spindle, the chromosomes will likely be distributed unequally and randomly to the daughter cells. This would result in daughter cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes, a condition called aneuploidy.

4.  **Cell Death (Apoptosis):** Cells with aneuploidy are often unstable and non-functional. The cell may initiate programmed cell death (apoptosis) to eliminate cells with damaged or incomplete genetic information.

5.  **Formation of Multi-nucleated Cells:** In some instances, cytokinesis (the division of the cytoplasm) might still occur even if karyokinesis (nuclear division) is faulty. This could result in the formation of cells with multiple nuclei, each containing an abnormal set of chromosomes.

**In summary:** A chemical that disrupts mitotic spindle formation would severely impair or halt cell division. It would likely lead to chromosome segregation errors, aneuploidy, cell cycle arrest, cell death, or the formation of abnormal multi-nucleated cells. This highlights the critical role of the mitotic spindle in ensuring accurate and successful cell division, which is essential for growth, repair, and overall organismal health.

2.  Compare and contrast the significance of mitosis and meiosis in living organisms. Your answer should address the type of cells involved, the genetic outcome, and the roles of each process in growth, repair, and reproduction.
Sample Answer:
Mitosis and meiosis are two fundamental types of cell division that are essential for life, but they serve very different purposes. Here's a comparison highlighting their significance:

**Mitosis:**

*   **Type of Cells Involved:** Mitosis occurs in somatic cells (all cells in the body except for sex cells like sperm and egg).
*   **Genetic Outcome:** Mitosis results in two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. This is because the chromosomes are duplicated and then precisely separated, ensuring each new cell receives a complete and identical set of genetic information.
*   **Role in Growth, Repair, and Reproduction:**
    *   **Growth:** Mitosis is crucial for the growth of multicellular organisms. As organisms develop, cells divide mitotically to increase the number of cells, leading to tissue and organ development.
    *   **Repair:** Mitosis plays a vital role in repairing damaged tissues. When cells are injured or die, surrounding cells divide mitotically to replace the lost cells, facilitating wound healing and tissue regeneration.
    *   **Asexual Reproduction:** In some organisms, mitosis is the basis for asexual reproduction. For example, bacteria reproduce through binary fission, which is a type of mitosis.
*   **Chromosome Number:** Preserves the chromosome number (equational division). A diploid (2n) cell divides into two diploid (2n) cells.

**Meiosis:**

*   **Type of Cells Involved:** Meiosis occurs only in germ cells (cells that produce gametes: sperm in males and eggs in females).
*   **Genetic Outcome:** Meiosis results in four daughter cells that are genetically different from each other and from the parent cell. This is achieved through two key processes:
    *   **Crossing Over (Recombination):** During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes (pairs of chromosomes with the same genes) exchange genetic material. This creates new combinations of genes on each chromosome.
    *   **Independent Assortment:** During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate randomly, meaning that each daughter cell receives a different mix of maternal and paternal chromosomes.
*   **Role in Growth, Repair, and Reproduction:**
    *   **Sexual Reproduction:** Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction. It reduces the chromosome number in gametes by half. When a sperm and egg fuse during fertilization, the resulting zygote has the correct diploid number of chromosomes.
    *   **Genetic Diversity:** Meiosis generates genetic diversity within a population. Crossing over and independent assortment create a wide range of genetic combinations in gametes, which leads to offspring with unique traits. This genetic variation is essential for adaptation and evolution.
*   **Chromosome Number:** Reduces the chromosome number by half (reductional division). A diploid (2n) cell divides into four haploid (n) cells.

**Comparison Table:**

| Feature           | Mitosis                                     | Meiosis                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Cell Type         | Somatic cells                               | Germ cells                                    |
| Daughter Cells    | 2                                           | 4                                             |
| Genetic Identity  | Genetically identical to parent cell      | Genetically different from parent cell and each other |
| Chromosome Number | Same as parent cell (diploid to diploid)    | Half of parent cell (diploid to haploid)       |
| Purpose           | Growth, repair, asexual reproduction        | Sexual reproduction, genetic diversity        |
| Crossing Over     | Does not occur                              | Occurs during prophase I                      |

In summary, mitosis is like making exact copies for growth and repair, ensuring that each new cell has the same instructions. Meiosis, on the other hand, is like shuffling the deck of cards to create unique combinations for sexual reproduction, ultimately driving diversity and adaptation. Both processes are critical for the survival and continuation of life.

3.  A researcher is studying a cell with a mutation that causes it to skip the G1 and G2 phases of interphase, proceeding directly from DNA replication (S phase) to M phase. Predict and explain the potential consequences of this mutation on the daughter cells produced during mitosis.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the consequences of skipping G1 and G2 phases in the cell cycle, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:

**Answer:**

The G1 and G2 phases of interphase are crucial checkpoints within the cell cycle, ensuring proper cell growth, accumulation of necessary resources, and accurate DNA replication before mitosis (M phase) occurs. If a cell were to skip these phases due to a mutation, proceeding directly from S phase (DNA replication) to M phase, significant consequences for the daughter cells are highly probable.

Here's a breakdown of the potential effects:

1.  **Reduced Cell Size:** The G1 phase is a period of significant cell growth. Skipping G1 means the cell enters S phase smaller than normal. While DNA replication occurs, the cell doesn't have the opportunity to accumulate sufficient cytoplasm, organelles, and other essential cellular components. Consequently, the daughter cells produced after mitosis would likely be significantly smaller than normal. These smaller cells might not have enough resources to function properly or even survive.

2.  **Compromised DNA Integrity and Increased Mutations:** The G2 phase serves as a crucial checkpoint to ensure that DNA replication during the S phase has been completed accurately and any DNA damage is repaired. Bypassing G2 means the cell enters mitosis with potentially unrepaired DNA damage or errors in replication. This would lead to a higher mutation rate in the daughter cells. These mutations could affect various cellular functions, potentially leading to cell death, uncontrolled cell growth (cancer), or other cellular malfunctions.

3.  **Insufficient Organelles and Resources:** Both G1 and G2 phases involve the synthesis of proteins and organelles required for cell division and the proper functioning of daughter cells. Skipping these phases would result in daughter cells with a deficit of essential organelles like ribosomes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum. This would impair their ability to synthesize proteins, produce energy, and carry out other vital metabolic processes, affecting their overall viability and function.

4.  **Chromosome Segregation Errors:** The G2 phase also allows the cell to prepare for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Important proteins required for spindle formation are produced during this phase. Skipping G2 increases the risk of errors during chromosome segregation in mitosis (non-disjunction). This could lead to daughter cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes (aneuploidy), which is often lethal or results in severe developmental abnormalities.

In conclusion, a mutation that causes a cell to skip the G1 and G2 phases would have severe and detrimental consequences for the resulting daughter cells. They would likely be smaller, contain damaged DNA, lack sufficient organelles, and potentially have an incorrect number of chromosomes. These factors would significantly compromise their viability, function, and genetic stability, potentially leading to various cellular dysfunctions or cell death. The carefully regulated cell cycle with its checkpoint mechanisms is essential for maintaining cellular health and preventing disease.
