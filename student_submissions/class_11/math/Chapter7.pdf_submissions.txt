1.  **Coefficient Conundrum:** Determine the coefficient of x<sup>5</sup> in the expansion of (2x<sup>2</sup> - 3/x)<sup>10</sup>. Explain the steps involved in arriving at your answer, clearly stating the term containing x<sup>5</sup> and how the coefficient is calculated.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:

**Answer:**

To find the coefficient of x<sup>5</sup> in the expansion of (2x<sup>2</sup> - 3/x)<sup>10</sup>, we'll use the Binomial Theorem. The general term in the binomial expansion of (a + b)<sup>n</sup> is given by:

T<sub>r+1</sub> = <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> * a<sup>n-r</sup> * b<sup>r</sup>

In our case, a = 2x<sup>2</sup>, b = -3/x, and n = 10. So, the (r+1)<sup>th</sup> term is:

T<sub>r+1</sub> = <sup>10</sup>C<sub>r</sub> * (2x<sup>2</sup>)<sup>10-r</sup> * (-3/x)<sup>r</sup>

Now, we simplify this term to find the power of x:

T<sub>r+1</sub> = <sup>10</sup>C<sub>r</sub> * 2<sup>10-r</sup> * x<sup>2(10-r)</sup> * (-3)<sup>r</sup> * x<sup>-r</sup>

T<sub>r+1</sub> = <sup>10</sup>C<sub>r</sub> * 2<sup>10-r</sup> * (-3)<sup>r</sup> * x<sup>20-2r-r</sup>

T<sub>r+1</sub> = <sup>10</sup>C<sub>r</sub> * 2<sup>10-r</sup> * (-3)<sup>r</sup> * x<sup>20-3r</sup>

We want to find the coefficient of x<sup>5</sup>.  Therefore, we need to find the value of 'r' for which the power of x is 5:

20 - 3r = 5

3r = 15

r = 5

Now that we have found the value of r = 5, we can substitute it back into the general term to find the specific term containing x<sup>5</sup>:

T<sub>5+1</sub> = T<sub>6</sub> = <sup>10</sup>C<sub>5</sub> * 2<sup>10-5</sup> * (-3)<sup>5</sup> * x<sup>5</sup>

T<sub>6</sub> = <sup>10</sup>C<sub>5</sub> * 2<sup>5</sup> * (-3)<sup>5</sup> * x<sup>5</sup>

Now, we calculate the binomial coefficient <sup>10</sup>C<sub>5</sub>:

<sup>10</sup>C<sub>5</sub> = 10! / (5! * 5!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 252

Substitute this value back into the term:

T<sub>6</sub> = 252 * 32 * (-243) * x<sup>5</sup>

T<sub>6</sub> = -1959552 * x<sup>5</sup>

Therefore, the coefficient of x<sup>5</sup> in the expansion of (2x<sup>2</sup> - 3/x)<sup>10</sup> is -1959552.

**In summary:**

1.  **General Term:** We used the general term formula from the Binomial Theorem.
2.  **Power of x:**  We determined the power of x in the general term and set it equal to 5 (since we want the coefficient of x<sup>5</sup>).
3.  **Solve for r:** We solved for 'r' to find which term in the expansion contains x<sup>5</sup>.
4.  **Substitute r:** We substituted the value of 'r' back into the general term.
5.  **Calculate:** We calculated the binomial coefficient and simplified the expression to find the coefficient of x<sup>5</sup>. The term containing x<sup>5</sup> is -1959552x<sup>5</sup>, and thus the coefficient of x<sup>5</sup> is -1959552.

2.  **Approximation Application:** Use the Binomial Theorem to approximate the value of (1.02)<sup>8</sup> to three decimal places. Justify your choice of terms to include in the approximation and explain why higher-order terms can be neglected.

Here's a sample answer to the given assignment question, suitable for CBSE class 11-12 students, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:

**Question:** Use the Binomial Theorem to approximate the value of (1.02)<sup>8</sup> to three decimal places. Justify your choice of terms to include in the approximation and explain why higher-order terms can be neglected.

**Answer:**

We want to approximate (1.02)<sup>8</sup> using the Binomial Theorem. We can rewrite 1.02 as (1 + 0.02). Now we can apply the Binomial Theorem:

(1 + x)<sup>n</sup> = <sup>n</sup>C<sub>0</sub>(1)<sup>n</sup> + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>1</sub>(1)<sup>n-1</sup>(x) + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>2</sub>(1)<sup>n-2</sup>(x)<sup>2</sup> + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>3</sub>(1)<sup>n-3</sup>(x)<sup>3</sup> + ... + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n</sub>(x)<sup>n</sup>

In our case, x = 0.02 and n = 8.  Let's calculate the first few terms of the expansion:

*   **Term 1:** <sup>8</sup>C<sub>0</sub>(1)<sup>8</sup> = 1 * 1 = 1
*   **Term 2:** <sup>8</sup>C<sub>1</sub>(1)<sup>7</sup>(0.02) = 8 * 1 * 0.02 = 0.16
*   **Term 3:** <sup>8</sup>C<sub>2</sub>(1)<sup>6</sup>(0.02)<sup>2</sup> = 28 * 1 * 0.0004 = 0.0112
*   **Term 4:** <sup>8</sup>C<sub>3</sub>(1)<sup>5</sup>(0.02)<sup>3</sup> = 56 * 1 * 0.000008 = 0.000448
*   **Term 5:** <sup>8</sup>C<sub>4</sub>(1)<sup>4</sup>(0.02)<sup>4</sup> = 70 * 1 * 0.00000016 = 0.0000112

Now let's add these terms:

1 + 0.16 + 0.0112 + 0.000448 + 0.0000112 = 1.1716592

To approximate to three decimal places, we need to consider the magnitude of the terms. Notice that each subsequent term becomes significantly smaller due to the increasing power of 0.02.

*   Term 1: 1
*   Term 2: 0.16
*   Term 3: 0.011
*   Term 4: 0.000
*   Term 5: 0.000

**Justification:**

We can neglect higher-order terms because they become increasingly insignificant as 'r' increases in the binomial expansion. This is because 'x' (0.02 in our case) is a small value (much less than 1).  When a small number is raised to higher powers, the resulting value rapidly approaches zero.  Therefore, the contribution of these higher-order terms to the final sum is negligible when we are approximating to a specific number of decimal places.

In this case, Term 4 is 0.000448 and Term 5 is 0.0000112.

Therefore, after the third term i.e. 0.0112, all the terms will have no contribution to the 3rd decimal place and hence can be neglected

**Approximation:**

Therefore, (1.02)<sup>8</sup> ≈ 1 + 0.16 + 0.0112 = 1.1712. Rounding this to three decimal places, we get:

(1.02)<sup>8</sup> ≈ 1.171

**Final Answer:**

The approximate value of (1.02)<sup>8</sup> to three decimal places is 1.171. We included the first three terms of the binomial expansion and neglected higher-order terms because their contribution is insignificant when approximating to three decimal places, due to the small value of x = 0.02 raised to higher powers.

3.  **Divisibility Dilemma:** Using the Binomial Theorem, prove that for any positive integer 'n', the expression 3<sup>2n</sup> - 8n - 1 is always divisible by 64.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content and explanations.

**Question:** Using the Binomial Theorem, prove that for any positive integer 'n', the expression 3<sup>2n</sup> - 8n - 1 is always divisible by 64.

**Answer:**

To prove that 3<sup>2n</sup> - 8n - 1 is divisible by 64 for all positive integers 'n', we will use the Binomial Theorem.  The key idea is to rewrite 3<sup>2n</sup> in a form suitable for applying the theorem.

1.  **Rewrite the expression:**

    First, notice that 3<sup>2n</sup> can be rewritten as (3<sup>2</sup>)<sup>n</sup>, which is equal to 9<sup>n</sup>.  Now, we can express 9 as (1 + 8).  Therefore, we have:

    3<sup>2n</sup> = 9<sup>n</sup> = (1 + 8)<sup>n</sup>

2.  **Apply the Binomial Theorem:**

    Using the Binomial Theorem to expand (1 + 8)<sup>n</sup>, we get:

    (1 + 8)<sup>n</sup> = <sup>n</sup>C<sub>0</sub>(1)<sup>n</sup> + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>1</sub>(1)<sup>n-1</sup>(8) + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>2</sub>(1)<sup>n-2</sup>(8)<sup>2</sup> + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>3</sub>(1)<sup>n-3</sup>(8)<sup>3</sup> + ... + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n</sub>(8)<sup>n</sup>

3.  **Simplify the expansion:**

    Recall that <sup>n</sup>C<sub>0</sub> = 1 and <sup>n</sup>C<sub>1</sub> = n.  Also, any power of 1 is simply 1.  Therefore, the expansion simplifies to:

    (1 + 8)<sup>n</sup> = 1 + n(8) + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>2</sub>(8)<sup>2</sup> + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>3</sub>(8)<sup>3</sup> + ... + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n</sub>(8)<sup>n</sup>

    (1 + 8)<sup>n</sup> = 1 + 8n + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>2</sub>(64) + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>3</sub>(512) + ... + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n</sub>(8)<sup>n</sup>

4.  **Substitute back into the original expression:**

    Now, substitute this expansion of (1 + 8)<sup>n</sup>  back into the original expression:

    3<sup>2n</sup> - 8n - 1 = (1 + 8n + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>2</sub>(64) + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>3</sub>(512) + ... + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n</sub>(8)<sup>n</sup>) - 8n - 1

    3<sup>2n</sup> - 8n - 1 = 1 + 8n + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>2</sub>(64) + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>3</sub>(512) + ... + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n</sub>(8)<sup>n</sup> - 8n - 1

5.  **Observe the terms:**

    Notice that the '1' and '8n' terms cancel out:

    3<sup>2n</sup> - 8n - 1 = <sup>n</sup>C<sub>2</sub>(64) + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>3</sub>(512) + ... + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n</sub>(8)<sup>n</sup>

    3<sup>2n</sup> - 8n - 1 =  64(<sup>n</sup>C<sub>2</sub> + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>3</sub>(8) + ... + <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n</sub>(8)<sup>n-2</sup>)

6.  **Conclusion:**

    From the simplified expression, we can see that every term contains a factor of 64.  Therefore, the entire expression 3<sup>2n</sup> - 8n - 1 is a multiple of 64.  This means that 3<sup>2n</sup> - 8n - 1 is always divisible by 64 for any positive integer 'n'.

**Therefore, we have proved that 3<sup>2n</sup> - 8n - 1 is divisible by 64 using the Binomial Theorem.**
