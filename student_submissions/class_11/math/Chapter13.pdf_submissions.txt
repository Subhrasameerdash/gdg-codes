1.  **Comparative Analysis of Batting Consistency:** Two cricketers, Virat and Rohit, have the same average score over a series of innings. However, Virat's scores have a higher standard deviation than Rohit's. Explain what this difference in standard deviation implies about the consistency and reliability of each batsman's performance. Which batsman would be a safer choice for a crucial match, and why?
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for CBSE Class 11-12 students, based on the provided chapter content:

**Answer:**

The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out a set of data is. In the context of cricket scores, a higher standard deviation means that the batsman's scores are more variable and scattered, while a lower standard deviation indicates that the scores are clustered more closely around the average.

In this scenario, Virat and Rohit have the same average score, but Virat's scores have a higher standard deviation. This implies the following:

*   **Virat:** Virat's scores are less consistent. He might have some very high scores and some very low scores, leading to a larger spread around his average. This makes his performance less predictable.

*   **Rohit:** Rohit's scores are more consistent. His scores are generally closer to his average, meaning he performs more reliably in each inning. There are fewer extreme highs and lows.

**Reliability and Safer Choice:**

For a crucial match, **Rohit would be the safer choice.** Here's why:

*   **Predictability:** Because Rohit has a lower standard deviation, his performance is more predictable. The team can be reasonably confident that he will score close to his average.

*   **Risk Mitigation:** While Virat might occasionally score exceptionally high, the higher standard deviation means there's also a greater risk of him scoring very low. In a crucial match, the team needs a batsman they can rely on to contribute a steady score. Rohit provides that reliability.

*   **Consistency over Brilliance:** In high-pressure situations, consistency is often more valuable than the potential for brilliance. A batsman who consistently scores around the average is less likely to crumble under pressure compared to someone prone to extreme fluctuations.

**In conclusion:** Even though Virat and Rohit have the same average, the difference in their standard deviations reveals crucial information about their consistency. Rohit's lower standard deviation makes him the more reliable and, therefore, the safer choice for a crucial match.

2.  **Impact of Outliers on Dispersion:** A dataset of employee salaries in a company has a significantly high outlier due to the CEO's salary. Discuss how the range, mean deviation (about the mean), and standard deviation would be affected by the presence of this outlier. Which measure of dispersion would be least affected and provide the most accurate representation of salary dispersion among the majority of employees? Justify your answer.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer appropriate for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the impact of outliers on measures of dispersion, based on the provided NCERT chapter content.

**Answer:**

The presence of an outlier, like the CEO's exceptionally high salary in a dataset of employee salaries, significantly impacts different measures of dispersion in varying degrees. Let's examine how the range, mean deviation (about the mean), and standard deviation are affected:

*   **Range:** The range is *most* sensitive to outliers.  Since the range is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values, the CEO's very high salary will dramatically increase the maximum value, leading to a much larger range. This inflated range will misrepresent the salary dispersion among the *majority* of employees. For example, if the lowest salary is 20,000 and the CEO salary is 2,000,000, the range becomes 1,980,000, which isn't representative of the spread of salaries for regular employees.

*   **Mean Deviation (about the Mean):** The mean deviation is also affected by outliers, though not as drastically as the range. The outlier increases the mean of the entire dataset. Because the mean is higher due to the outlier, the deviations of *all* the other data points from the mean will, on average, be larger. This leads to a higher mean deviation, again overestimating the typical spread of salaries.

*   **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation is the *most* sensitive of the three to outliers.  This is because the standard deviation is calculated using the *squared* deviations from the mean. Squaring the deviations gives disproportionately greater weight to extreme values (outliers). The CEO's large salary will create a very large squared deviation, inflating the variance and, consequently, the standard deviation significantly. This means the standard deviation will provide a distorted picture of how much the salaries vary around the *average* salary for most employees.

**Which measure is least affected and most accurate?**

The **mean deviation about the median** is the least affected by outliers and provides the most accurate representation of salary dispersion among the majority of employees *if we used mean deviation about median instead of mean deviation about mean*.

**Justification:**

The median is a measure of central tendency that is resistant to outliers. Unlike the mean, the median is not pulled towards extreme values. Since the median salary will likely fall within the range of salaries of the majority of employees (excluding the CEO), the absolute deviations from the median will be smaller and more representative of the typical salary differences within the company. As a result, the mean deviation about the median will provide a more realistic view of the salary dispersion, ignoring the distorting effect of the CEO's salary.

If, we used the mean deviation about the mean it would still be affected by the outlier, as the outlier would affect the calculation of the mean.
In summary, when dealing with datasets containing outliers, relying solely on the range or standard deviation can be misleading. Measures that are less sensitive to extreme values, such as the mean deviation (especially about the median), offer a more accurate and reliable representation of the data's true dispersion.

3.  **Applying Measures of Dispersion in Real-World Scenario:** A quality control engineer is analyzing the lifespan of two brands of light bulbs, Brand A and Brand B. After testing a sample of each brand, the engineer finds that Brand A has a lower mean lifespan but also a lower variance compared to Brand B. In terms of consumer satisfaction and warranty considerations, which brand would you recommend? Explain your reasoning, considering both the average lifespan and the variability in lifespan for each brand.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the light bulb scenario:

**Answer:**

To recommend a brand of light bulb, the quality control engineer must consider both the mean lifespan and the variance because these factors significantly impact consumer satisfaction and warranty costs. Here's an analysis:

*   **Brand A: Lower Mean Lifespan, Lower Variance** This means that, on average, Brand A bulbs last for a shorter time compared to Brand B. However, the lower variance indicates that the lifespan of Brand A bulbs is more consistent and predictable.  The individual lifespans are clustered more closely around the mean.

*   **Brand B: Higher Mean Lifespan, Higher Variance** This means that, on average, Brand B bulbs last longer than Brand A bulbs. However, the higher variance signifies that the lifespan of Brand B bulbs is less consistent. Some bulbs might last a very long time, while others might fail much sooner. The individual lifespans are more spread out around the mean.

**Recommendation and Reasoning:**

The optimal choice depends on the priorities of the consumer and the company's risk tolerance regarding warranty claims:

*   **For Consumers Prioritizing Predictability:** Brand A might be preferred if consumers value knowing roughly how long their light bulbs will last.  Even though the average lifespan is shorter, the consistent performance minimizes the chance of unexpected early failures. This is good for budgeting replacement costs.

*   **For Consumers Prioritizing Longevity (with Risk):** Brand B might appeal to consumers who are primarily focused on getting the longest possible lifespan from their bulbs. However, they need to be aware that they are also accepting a higher risk of a bulb failing relatively early.

*   **For the Company Considering Warranty Costs:** This is the most complex consideration.
    *   A higher variance (Brand B) means more bulbs will fail *before* the average lifespan. This directly translates to more warranty claims if the company offers a warranty. Even though some Brand B bulbs last much longer, the increased frequency of early failures will likely increase warranty costs.
    *   A lower variance (Brand A) makes warranty costs more predictable. The company can more accurately estimate the number of failures within the warranty period. Even though Brand A has a lower average lifespan, the reduced number of warranty claims and more predictable replacement cycles might make it a more profitable option.

**Conclusion:**

From a business perspective, **Brand A is likely the better recommendation**. While the higher average lifespan of Brand B seems initially appealing, the greater variability in lifespan significantly increases the financial risk associated with warranty claims. By choosing Brand A, the company can offer a more reliable product, minimize warranty expenses, and potentially increase customer satisfaction through predictable performance. However, the company could market Brand B to consumers willing to accept the risk of early failure for the possibility of extended lifespan.
