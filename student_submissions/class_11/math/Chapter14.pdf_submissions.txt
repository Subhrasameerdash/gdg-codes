1.  **Event Probability and Sample Space:** A standard six-sided die is rolled twice. Define event A as "the sum of the two rolls is a prime number" and event B as "the first roll is greater than the second roll". Calculate the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred. Explain your reasoning, clearly outlining the relevant sample space and probabilities.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT content, for the given assignment question.

**Answer:**

To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). This formula gives the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred.

**1. Defining the Sample Space:**

When a standard six-sided die is rolled twice, the sample space S consists of 36 possible outcomes, each represented as an ordered pair (x, y), where x is the result of the first roll and y is the result of the second roll.  S = {(1,1), (1,2), ..., (6,6)}.

**2. Defining Events A and B:**

*   **Event A: The sum of the two rolls is a prime number.**  The prime numbers that can be obtained as a sum of two dice rolls are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.  Let's list the outcomes that satisfy event A:

    A = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1), (5,6), (6,5)}
    There are 15 such outcomes.

*   **Event B: The first roll is greater than the second roll.** Let's list the outcomes:

    B = {(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)}
    There are 15 such outcomes.

**3. Finding the Intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):**

We need to find the outcomes that satisfy both event A *and* event B.

A ∩ B = {(2,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,3), (5,2), (5,4), (6,1), (6,5)}

There are 8 such outcomes.

**4. Calculating Probabilities:**

*   **P(A ∩ B):** The probability of both A and B occurring is the number of outcomes in A ∩ B divided by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.

    P(A ∩ B) = 8/36 = 2/9

*   **P(B):** The probability of event B occurring is the number of outcomes in B divided by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.

    P(B) = 15/36 = 5/12

**5. Calculating the Conditional Probability P(A|B):**

Now we can use the formula for conditional probability:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = (2/9) / (5/12) = (2/9) * (12/5) = 24/45 = 8/15

**Conclusion:**

The probability of the sum of the two rolls being a prime number, given that the first roll is greater than the second roll, is 8/15.

2.  **Axiomatic Probability and Set Theory:** Suppose events X, Y, and Z are associated with a random experiment. Given that P(X) = 0.4, P(Y) = 0.5, P(Z) = 0.3, P(X ∩ Y) = 0.2, P(Y ∩ Z) = 0.1, and P(X ∩ Z) = 0.15, and P(X ∩ Y ∩ Z) = 0.05, find the probability that at least one of the events X, Y, or Z occurs. Justify your answer using the principles of axiomatic probability.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT content and the given assignment question:

**Answer:**

To find the probability that at least one of the events X, Y, or Z occurs, we need to find P(X ∪ Y ∪ Z). We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate this probability.  This principle is a direct consequence of axiomatic probability and set theory relationships.

The formula for the probability of the union of three events is:

P(X ∪ Y ∪ Z) = P(X) + P(Y) + P(Z) - P(X ∩ Y) - P(X ∩ Z) - P(Y ∩ Z) + P(X ∩ Y ∩ Z)

We are given the following probabilities:

*   P(X) = 0.4
*   P(Y) = 0.5
*   P(Z) = 0.3
*   P(X ∩ Y) = 0.2
*   P(Y ∩ Z) = 0.1
*   P(X ∩ Z) = 0.15
*   P(X ∩ Y ∩ Z) = 0.05

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P(X ∪ Y ∪ Z) = 0.4 + 0.5 + 0.3 - 0.2 - 0.15 - 0.1 + 0.05

P(X ∪ Y ∪ Z) = 1.2 - 0.45 + 0.05

P(X ∪ Y ∪ Z) = 0.75 + 0.05

P(X ∪ Y ∪ Z) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that at least one of the events X, Y, or Z occurs is 0.8.

**Justification using principles of axiomatic probability:**

The axiomatic approach to probability is based on the following axioms:

1.  **For any event A, P(A) ≥ 0:**  This axiom states that the probability of any event must be non-negative.  All the individual probabilities given in the problem satisfy this condition.

2.  **P(S) = 1, where S is the sample space:**  The probability of the entire sample space (i.e., that *some* outcome occurs) is 1.

3.  **For mutually exclusive events A and B, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B):**  This axiom states that if two events cannot occur at the same time, the probability of either one occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities. The inclusion-exclusion principle we used is an extension of this axiom to non-mutually exclusive events.

The inclusion-exclusion principle itself can be derived by considering how probabilities are assigned to sets.  When we add P(X), P(Y), and P(Z), we are counting the probabilities of the intersections (X ∩ Y, X ∩ Z, Y ∩ Z) multiple times.  Therefore, we must subtract these intersection probabilities.  However, by subtracting the intersections, we have now subtracted the probability of the triple intersection (X ∩ Y ∩ Z) too many times, so we must add it back in.

The result, P(X ∪ Y ∪ Z) = 0.8, adheres to the first axiom (P(A) ≥ 0). Also, since 0 ≤ P(X ∪ Y ∪ Z) ≤ 1, it is a valid probability value within the sample space. If X, Y, and Z covered the entire sample space S then  P(X ∪ Y ∪ Z) would equal 1, but this is not a requirement of the problem. The principle of inclusion/exclusion correctly accounts for overlapping events, derived through logical set operations and conforming to probability axioms.

3.  **Conditional Probability in Real-World Scenarios:** A company has two factories that produce light bulbs. Factory A produces 60% of the bulbs, and Factory B produces 40%. 2% of the bulbs from Factory A are defective, while 3% of the bulbs from Factory B are defective. If a randomly selected bulb is found to be defective, what is the probability that it was produced by Factory A? Explain how you arrived at your answer using conditional probability.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, explaining conditional probability with a clear, step-by-step approach:

**Answer:**

This problem involves conditional probability. We want to find the probability that a defective bulb was produced by Factory A, given that it *is* defective.  Let's define the following events:

*   A: The event that the bulb was produced by Factory A.
*   B: The event that the bulb was produced by Factory B.
*   D: The event that the bulb is defective.

We are given the following probabilities:

*   P(A) = 0.60 (Probability that a bulb is from Factory A)
*   P(B) = 0.40 (Probability that a bulb is from Factory B)
*   P(D|A) = 0.02 (Probability that a bulb is defective given it's from Factory A)
*   P(D|B) = 0.03 (Probability that a bulb is defective given it's from Factory B)

We want to find P(A|D), which is the probability that the bulb came from Factory A, *given* that it is defective.  We can use Bayes' Theorem to solve this:

P(A|D) = [P(D|A) * P(A)] / P(D)

First, we need to find P(D), the overall probability that a bulb is defective. We can find this using the law of total probability:

P(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B)

P(D) = (0.02 * 0.60) + (0.03 * 0.40)
P(D) = 0.012 + 0.012
P(D) = 0.024

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|D) = (0.02 * 0.60) / 0.024
P(A|D) = 0.012 / 0.024
P(A|D) = 0.5

Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected defective bulb was produced by Factory A is 0.5 or 50%.

**Explanation:**

*   **Bayes' Theorem:** This theorem is crucial for calculating conditional probabilities when you want to reverse the conditioning (i.e., find P(A|D) given P(D|A)).
*   **Law of Total Probability:** This law helps us find the overall probability of an event (in this case, a bulb being defective) by considering all possible ways that event can occur (defective bulbs from Factory A and defective bulbs from Factory B).
*   **Understanding the Problem:** It's important to clearly define the events and probabilities given in the problem. Misinterpreting these values will lead to an incorrect answer.  We needed to find the probability a bulb came from A *given* that it was defective, not the probability that a bulb from A is defective.
*   **Step-by-Step Calculation:**  Breaking down the problem into smaller steps (calculating P(D) first) makes it easier to understand and reduces the chance of errors.
