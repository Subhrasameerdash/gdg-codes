1.  A student needs an average of at least 60 marks on three tests to achieve a passing grade. They scored 52 and 68 on the first two tests. What range of scores on the third test will guarantee a passing grade? Express your answer as an inequality and represent the solution set on a number line.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content on linear inequalities:

**Answer:**

To determine the range of scores the student needs on the third test to achieve a passing grade (average of at least 60), we can set up an inequality. Let 'x' represent the score on the third test.

**1. Setting up the Inequality:**

The average of the three test scores is calculated as: (Score on Test 1 + Score on Test 2 + Score on Test 3) / 3.  We want this average to be greater than or equal to 60.  Therefore, the inequality is:

(52 + 68 + x) / 3 ≥ 60

**2. Solving the Inequality:**

*   First, simplify the numerator:
    (120 + x) / 3 ≥ 60
*   Multiply both sides of the inequality by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
    120 + x ≥ 180
*   Subtract 120 from both sides to isolate 'x':
    x ≥ 60

**3. Interpretation and Solution:**

The solution x ≥ 60 means that the student needs to score at least 60 marks on the third test to achieve a passing grade of 60 or higher.

**4. Representing the Solution Set on a Number Line:**

To represent this solution on a number line:

*   Draw a number line.
*   Locate the point 60 on the number line.
*   Since x is greater than *or equal to* 60, we use a closed circle (or a filled-in dot) at the point 60 to indicate that 60 is included in the solution.
*   Draw an arrow extending to the right from the closed circle, indicating that all values greater than 60 are also part of the solution.

**Number Line Representation:**

```
<-------------------------------------------------->
... 55   56   57   58   59  [60]-->>> 61   62   63 ...

[ represents a closed circle
--->>> represents the arrow extending to the right
```

**Conclusion:**

The student must score 60 or more on the third test to ensure a passing grade.  The inequality representing this is x ≥ 60, and the number line visually represents all possible scores that satisfy this condition.

2.  A company produces two types of widgets, A and B. The cost of producing each widget A is ₹15 and each widget B is ₹20. The company has a total budget of ₹12,000. If they must produce at least 200 widgets in total, and the number of widget A produced is at least twice the number of widget B produced, formulate the constraints as a system of linear inequalities. Do not solve.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content and incorporating clear explanations:

**Answer:**

To formulate the constraints for the company's widget production problem as a system of linear inequalities, we need to define our variables first.

Let:

*   *x* represent the number of widget A produced.
*   *y* represent the number of widget B produced.

Now, let's translate each condition in the problem into an inequality:

1.  **Budget Constraint:** The cost of producing *x* widgets of type A is 15*x*, and the cost of producing *y* widgets of type B is 20*y*. The total cost cannot exceed the budget of ₹12,000.  Therefore, the inequality is:

    15*x* + 20*y* ≤ 12000

2.  **Minimum Production Constraint:** The company must produce at least 200 widgets in total.  This means the sum of widget A and widget B must be greater than or equal to 200. Therefore, the inequality is:

    *x* + *y* ≥ 200

3.  **Production Ratio Constraint:** The number of widget A produced (*x*) must be at least twice the number of widget B produced (*y*). This translates to:

    *x* ≥ 2*y*

4. **Non-Negativity Constraints:**  Since we cannot produce a negative number of widgets, we must also include the following constraints:
    * x ≥ 0
    * y ≥ 0

Therefore, the system of linear inequalities representing the constraints is:

*   15*x* + 20*y* ≤ 12000
*   *x* + *y* ≥ 200
*   *x* ≥ 2*y*
*   *x* ≥ 0
*   *y* ≥ 0

**Explanation of each constraint:**

*   **Budget Constraint:**  This inequality ensures that the total production cost stays within the allocated budget of ₹12,000. The left-hand side represents the total cost of producing *x* widgets A and *y* widgets B.
*   **Minimum Production Constraint:**  This inequality guarantees that the company meets its minimum production target of 200 widgets. The left-hand side represents the total number of widgets produced.
*   **Production Ratio Constraint:** This inequality reflects the requirement that the production of widget A is at least twice the production of widget B.
*   **Non-Negativity Constraints:** These constraints are fundamental because we cannot produce a negative quantity of widgets. Production quantities must be zero or positive.

3.  Solve the following compound inequality and graphically represent the solution on a number line: -10 < (2 - 3x)/4 ≤ 2.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, designed for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content.

**Question:** Solve the following compound inequality and graphically represent the solution on a number line: -10 < (2 - 3x)/4 ≤ 2.

**Answer:**

To solve the compound inequality  -10 < (2 - 3x)/4 ≤ 2, we need to isolate 'x' in the middle. We'll do this by performing the same operations on all three parts of the inequality.

**Step 1: Multiply all parts by 4**

Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 4, we get:

-10 * 4 < (2 - 3x)/4 * 4 ≤ 2 * 4

-40 < 2 - 3x ≤ 8

**Step 2: Subtract 2 from all parts**

Subtracting 2 from all parts of the inequality, we have:

-40 - 2 < 2 - 3x - 2 ≤ 8 - 2

-42 < -3x ≤ 6

**Step 3: Divide all parts by -3 (and reverse the inequality signs)**

Dividing all parts of the inequality by -3.  Remember that when dividing or multiplying an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality signs:

-42 / -3 > -3x / -3 ≥ 6 / -3

14 > x ≥ -2

We can rewrite this as:

-2 ≤ x < 14

**Step 4: Graphical Representation on a Number Line**

To represent this solution on a number line:

1.  **Draw a number line.**
2.  **Locate -2 and 14 on the number line.**
3.  **Place a closed circle (filled-in circle) at -2** because the inequality includes "-2" (x ≥ -2).  This indicates that -2 is part of the solution.
4.  **Place an open circle (hollow circle) at 14** because the inequality does *not* include "14" (x < 14). This indicates that 14 is *not* part of the solution.
5.  **Shade (or draw a thick line) the region between -2 and 14** to represent all the values of x that satisfy the inequality.

```
<-------------------------------------------------------->
     -3  -2  -1   0   1   2 ... 12  13  14  15
      *===[---------------------------)
      ^                               ^
      |                               |
   Closed circle                    Open Circle
   (includes -2)                   (excludes 14)
```

**Conclusion:**

The solution to the compound inequality -10 < (2 - 3x)/4 ≤ 2  is -2 ≤ x < 14. This means x can be any real number greater than or equal to -2, but strictly less than 14.  The number line representation visually shows all the values of x that satisfy this condition.
