Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the given assignment question:

**Answer:**

**Understanding the Problem:**

The problem describes a line segment AB in 3D space. Point A lies on the XY-plane, meaning its z-coordinate is 0. Point B lies on the YZ-plane, meaning its x-coordinate is 0. We are given the midpoint of AB and need to deduce information about the possible coordinates of A and B.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **XY-plane:** Defined by z = 0. Any point on this plane has coordinates (x, y, 0).
*   **YZ-plane:** Defined by x = 0. Any point on this plane has coordinates (0, y, z).
*   **Midpoint Formula:**  The coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment joining points (x₁, y₁, z₁) and (x₂, y₂, z₂) are  ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2, (z₁ + z₂)/2).

**Solution:**

Let the coordinates of point A be (x₁, y₁, 0) and the coordinates of point B be (0, y₂, z₂).  We are given that the midpoint of AB is (2, -1, 3). Using the midpoint formula:

((x₁ + 0)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2, (0 + z₂)/2) = (2, -1, 3)

This gives us three equations:

1.  x₁/2 = 2  =>  x₁ = 4
2.  (y₁ + y₂)/2 = -1 => y₁ + y₂ = -2
3.  z₂/2 = 3  => z₂ = 6

**Determining the Ranges:**

*   **x-coordinate:**
    *   Since x₁ = 4, the x-coordinate of point A is fixed at 4.  Therefore, the range of x for point A is simply x = 4.
    *   The x-coordinate of point B is fixed at 0 (because it lies on the YZ-plane). Therefore, the range of x for point B is x = 0.

*   **y-coordinate:**
    *   We know that y₁ + y₂ = -2.  This means that y₁ = -2 - y₂.
    *   There are no explicit restrictions on the values of y₁ and y₂.  They can be any real numbers as long as their sum is -2.
    *   Therefore, the range of y for both point A and point B is all real numbers, subject to the condition that  y₁ + y₂ = -2. We can express this by saying:  y for point A can be any real number, and y for point B is -2 minus the y-coordinate of Point A.

*   **z-coordinate:**
    *   The z-coordinate of point A is fixed at 0 (because it lies on the XY-plane). Therefore, the range of z for point A is simply z = 0.
    *   Since z₂ = 6, the z-coordinate of point B is fixed at 6. Therefore, the range of z for point B is z = 6.

**Summary of Ranges:**

*   **Point A (x, y, z):**
    *   x = 4
    *   y: All real numbers.
    *   z = 0
*   **Point B (x, y, z):**
    *   x = 0
    *   y: All real numbers, where y = -2 - (y-coordinate of Point A)
    *   z = 6

**Conclusion:**

The x and z coordinates of points A and B are fixed due to the constraints of lying on the XY and YZ planes, respectively, and the given midpoint. The y-coordinates can take on any real values, as long as their sum equals -2. This demonstrates how the properties of coordinate planes and the midpoint formula can be used to deduce information about the possible locations of points in 3D space.

2.  **Problem Solving & Spatial Reasoning:** Imagine a cube with side length 'a' units, positioned such that one vertex coincides with the origin (0, 0, 0) and three edges extend along the positive x, y, and z axes. Determine the coordinates of all eight vertices of the cube. Then, calculate the distance between the vertex at the origin and the vertex farthest from the origin.
Sample Answer:
Here's a solution to the cube problem, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have a cube placed in the 3D coordinate system. One corner is at the origin (0,0,0), and the cube's edges align with the positive x, y, and z axes. We need to find the coordinates of all the corners (vertices) and the distance between the origin and the opposite corner.

**Solution:**

1.  **Identifying the Vertices:**

    Since the cube has a side length of 'a' and is aligned with the axes, we can systematically determine the coordinates of each vertex:

    *   **Origin:** (0, 0, 0)
    *   **Along x-axis:** (a, 0, 0)
    *   **Along y-axis:** (0, a, 0)
    *   **Along z-axis:** (0, 0, a)
    *   **In the xy-plane:** (a, a, 0)
    *   **In the xz-plane:** (a, 0, a)
    *   **In the yz-plane:** (0, a, a)
    *   **Farthest from the origin:** (a, a, a)

2.  **Calculating the Distance:**

    We need to find the distance between the origin (0, 0, 0) and the vertex farthest from it, which is (a, a, a). We use the distance formula:

    Distance = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² + (z₂ - z₁)²]

    Substituting the coordinates:

    Distance = √[(a - 0)² + (a - 0)² + (a - 0)²]
    Distance = √(a² + a² + a²)
    Distance = √(3a²)
    Distance = a√3

**Answer:**

The coordinates of the eight vertices of the cube are:

*   (0, 0, 0)
*   (a, 0, 0)
*   (0, a, 0)
*   (0, 0, a)
*   (a, a, 0)
*   (a, 0, a)
*   (0, a, a)
*   (a, a, a)

The distance between the origin and the vertex farthest from the origin is **a√3 units**.

3.  **Analytical & Proof-Based Question:** The points A(x,y,z), B(1,2,3) and C(-1,-2,-1) are collinear. Show that the ratio in which B divides AC is constant, irrespective of the value of x,y, and z. Find this ratio.
Sample Answer:
Here's a solution to the problem, suitable for a Class 11-12 student:

**Understanding Collinearity and Section Formula**

First, let's remember what it means for points to be collinear: they lie on the same straight line.  If B divides AC in some ratio, we can use the section formula to express the coordinates of B in terms of the coordinates of A and C, and the ratio. Our goal is to show that this ratio is constant, meaning it doesn't depend on the specific location of point A (represented by the variables x, y, and z).

**Applying the Section Formula**

Let's assume that B divides AC in the ratio *k:1*.  This means that for every *k* units of distance from A to B, there is 1 unit of distance from B to C. Using the section formula for 3D coordinates:

Coordinates of B =  [ (k * Coordinates of C + 1 * Coordinates of A) / (k + 1) ]

Applying this to each coordinate:

*   x-coordinate of B:  1 = (k * (-1) + 1 * x) / (k + 1)
*   y-coordinate of B:  2 = (k * (-2) + 1 * y) / (k + 1)
*   z-coordinate of B:  3 = (k * (-1) + 1 * z) / (k + 1)

**Solving for *k***

Now, let's solve each equation for *k*:

*   From the x-coordinate equation:
    1 = (-k + x) / (k + 1)
    k + 1 = -k + x
    2k = x - 1
    k = (x - 1) / 2

*   From the y-coordinate equation:
    2 = (-2k + y) / (k + 1)
    2k + 2 = -2k + y
    4k = y - 2
    k = (y - 2) / 4

*   From the z-coordinate equation:
    3 = (-k + z) / (k + 1)
    3k + 3 = -k + z
    4k = z - 3
    k = (z - 3) / 4

**Establishing the Constant Ratio**

Since all three equations must hold true simultaneously for the same value of *k*, we can equate any two of them to eliminate *k* and see what relationship exists between x, y, and z. However, notice something crucial: *we don't need to!*

Because A, B, and C are collinear, there can only be one valid k that defines their relative position.

Instead, observe that :
k = (y - 2) / 4
2k = (y-2)/2
Solving for y;
2k = (y-2)/2
4k = y-2
y = 4k + 2

Similarly:
k = (z - 3) / 4
4k = z-3
z = 4k+3

We can substitute these into the x equation to solve for k.

k = (x-1)/2
2k = x-1
x = 2k+1

This shows that regardless of the value of x,y, or z, the ratio k is constant.

To Find it:

We have B(1,2,3)
x = 1
y = 2
z = 3

Substitute any of these into the formulas for k above.
For example:
k = (x-1)/2 = (1-1)/2 = 0

*Important Caveat*
When k = 0, this means that B and A are the same point.

However, it is also equally valid to approach this from the other direction and compare to C to see what the value should be.

AC/CB = k
So CB/AC = 1/k

Thus, CB =  [ (k * Coordinates of A + 1 * Coordinates of C) / (k + 1) ]

Coordinates of B =  [ (k * (x,y,z) + 1 * (-1,-2,-1) ) / (k + 1) ]
x-coordinate of B:  1 = (k * (x) + 1 * (-1) ) / (k + 1)
y-coordinate of B:  2 = (k * (y) + 1 * (-2)) / (k + 1)
z-coordinate of B:  3 = (k * (z) + 1 * (-1) ) / (k + 1)

*   From the x-coordinate equation:
    1 = (kx - 1) / (k + 1)
    k + 1 = kx -1
    2 = kx-k
    2 = k(x-1)
    k = 2/(x-1)

*   From the y-coordinate equation:
    2 = (ky - 2) / (k + 1)
    2k + 2 = ky -2
    4 = ky-2k
    4 = k(y-2)
    k = 4/(y-2)

*   From the z-coordinate equation:
    3 = (kz - 1) / (k + 1)
    3k + 3 = kz - 1
    4 + 3k = kz
    4 = kz-3k
    4 = k(z-3)
    k = 4/(z-3)

Since k is constant, it means that  2/(x-1) = 4/(y-2) =  4/(z-3)

From the previous equations above we stated:
x = 2k+1
y = 4k+2
z = 4k+3

Substituting these new equations to confirm will produce the same ratios.
k = 2/(x-1)
k = 2/(2k+1 -1)
k = 2/2k
k^2 = 1
k = 1

Therefore the final answer is:

The ratio in which B divides AC is constant, irrespective of the value of x,y, and z, and that ratio is 1. B is thus the midpoint of A and C.

**Key Points**

*   The section formula is crucial for solving this type of problem.
*   The concept of collinearity implies a consistent relationship between the coordinates of the points.
*   While solving for *k*, be mindful of potential divisions by zero (which would imply that A and B, or B and C, coincide).
*   Express the final answer in a clear and concise manner.
