1.  A scientist measures the length of a newly discovered artifact to be 285 cm. Later, they need to present this length in a report that requires the measurement to be expressed in inches. Given that 1 inch = 2.54 cm, calculate the length of the artifact in inches, showing your working clearly with units.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content and the given assignment question.

**Answer:**

To convert the length of the artifact from centimeters (cm) to inches (in), we'll use the given conversion factor: 1 inch = 2.54 cm.

Here's how to calculate the length in inches:

1. **Identify the given quantity and the desired quantity:**

   *   Given: Length of the artifact = 285 cm
   *   Desired: Length of the artifact in inches

2. **Set up the conversion factor as a fraction:**

   Since we want to convert from cm to inches, we'll write the conversion factor with inches in the numerator and cm in the denominator:

   (1 inch / 2.54 cm)

3. **Multiply the given quantity by the conversion factor:**

   Length in inches = (Length in cm) * (Conversion factor)

   Length in inches = 285 cm * (1 inch / 2.54 cm)

4. **Perform the calculation:**

   Length in inches = 285 / 2.54 inches

   Length in inches ≈ 112.20 inches

5. **State the final answer with appropriate units:**

   Therefore, the length of the newly discovered artifact is approximately **112.20 inches**.

**Explanation:**

The key to this problem is using the conversion factor correctly. By setting up the conversion factor as a fraction with the desired unit (inches) in the numerator and the given unit (cm) in the denominator, we ensure that the "cm" units cancel out when we multiply, leaving us with the length expressed in inches.  This method is essentially using dimensional analysis, where units are handled like algebraic quantities, allowing us to convert between different units of measurement. The example provided in the NCERT content helps confirm that units can be handled like numerical values.

2.  Explain, using the concept of dimensional analysis, why it is crucial to handle units carefully in calculations. Illustrate your explanation with a hypothetical scenario where incorrect unit handling leads to a wrong conclusion.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content (which is admittedly sparse, so I'll be drawing upon general physics knowledge as well).

**Answer:**

Dimensional analysis is a powerful tool used in physics and other sciences to check the correctness of equations and conversions between different units. It relies on the principle that physical quantities have dimensions (like length [L], mass [M], and time [T]) that are independent of the units used to measure them. Handling units carefully in calculations is absolutely crucial because:

1.  **Ensuring Dimensional Consistency:** Every term in a valid physical equation must have the same dimensions. Dimensional analysis allows us to verify this consistency. If the dimensions on both sides of an equation don't match, it immediately indicates an error in the equation or the calculation.

2.  **Correct Unit Conversions:**  Often, problems involve quantities expressed in different units. Dimensional analysis helps us convert between these units correctly. By treating units as algebraic quantities, we can multiply and divide them to arrive at the desired units. Failing to convert units properly can lead to drastically wrong answers.

3.  **Identifying Errors:** Incorrect unit handling can lead to dimensionally incorrect results, immediately signaling an error in our calculations.

**Hypothetical Scenario Illustrating Incorrect Unit Handling:**

Imagine you are calculating the kinetic energy (KE) of a small toy car. The formula for kinetic energy is KE = (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup>, where 'm' is the mass and 'v' is the velocity.

Let's say:

*   Mass (m) = 50 grams
*   Velocity (v) = 10 cm/s

Now, let's calculate the KE *without* paying attention to unit consistency:

KE = (1/2) * 50 * (10)<sup>2</sup> = 2500

If we stop here, we might incorrectly assume the answer is 2500 Joules (J), which is a standard unit of energy. **However, this is wrong!**

*Why is it wrong?* Because the standard units for mass and velocity in the SI system (which gives Joules as the unit for energy) are kilograms (kg) and meters per second (m/s), respectively.

To get the correct answer, we need to convert:

*   50 grams = 0.05 kg
*   10 cm/s = 0.1 m/s

Now, the correct calculation is:

KE = (1/2) * 0.05 kg * (0.1 m/s)<sup>2</sup> = 0.00025 J

Therefore, the correct kinetic energy is 0.00025 Joules, a vastly different value than 2500 Joules!

**Conclusion:**

This scenario clearly demonstrates how neglecting to handle units carefully can lead to a completely erroneous result. Dimensional analysis and careful unit conversion are essential for obtaining accurate and meaningful answers in physics and other quantitative disciplines.

3.  A chemical reaction requires 1 mole of water (H₂O). You have a large container of water. If the reaction needs to run continuously for 2 full days, how many moles of water are required in total, expressed as moles per second? Show all conversion steps clearly.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, designed for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content.  It emphasizes clarity and step-by-step conversion.

**Answer:**

To determine the total moles of water required per second for the chemical reaction, we need to convert the given time (2 days) into seconds and then consider the requirement of 1 mole of water for each unit of the converted time.

Here's a breakdown of the conversion steps:

1. **Days to Hours:** There are 24 hours in a day.

   2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

2. **Hours to Minutes:** There are 60 minutes in an hour.

   48 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 2880 minutes

3. **Minutes to Seconds:** There are 60 seconds in a minute.

   2880 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 172800 seconds

Therefore, 2 days is equal to 172,800 seconds.

Since the reaction requires 1 mole of water for each second, and the reaction needs to run continuously for 172,800 seconds:

Total moles of water required = 172800 seconds * 1 mole/second = 172800 moles

So, 172,800 moles of water are required in total.

**Final Answer:** The chemical reaction requires **172,800 moles** of water to run continuously for 2 full days, which is equivalent to needing **1 mole per second**.
