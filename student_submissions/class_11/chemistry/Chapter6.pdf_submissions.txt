1.  Explain how the common ion effect influences the pH of a buffer solution. Use a specific example (other than the acetic acid example from the textbook) to illustrate your explanation. Furthermore, discuss why understanding this effect is crucial in biological systems.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer appropriate for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content and the assignment question:

**Answer:**

The common ion effect significantly impacts the pH of a buffer solution by suppressing the ionization of a weak acid or weak base. A buffer solution, by definition, contains a weak acid and its conjugate base (or a weak base and its conjugate acid) in equilibrium. The common ion effect describes what happens when we add a soluble salt containing an ion that is *common* to the buffer's equilibrium.

In simpler terms, adding more of one of the ions already present in the equilibrium forces the equilibrium to shift to counteract this change, according to Le Chatelier's principle.  This shift reduces the dissociation of the weak acid or base, thereby affecting the pH.

Let's consider an example using ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH), a weak base, and its conjugate acid, ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl). The equilibrium is:

NH<sub>4</sub>OH(aq)  ⇌  NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>(aq)  +  OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)

A buffer solution can be made by mixing NH<sub>4</sub>OH and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl.  Now, consider what happens when we add more NH<sub>4</sub>Cl to this buffer.  NH<sub>4</sub>Cl is a strong electrolyte and completely dissociates in water:

NH<sub>4</sub>Cl(aq)  →  NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>(aq)  +  Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq)

The addition of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl increases the concentration of the ammonium ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>). This increase in [NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>] shifts the equilibrium of the NH<sub>4</sub>OH dissociation to the *left*, according to Le Chatelier's principle. The equilibrium shifts towards the reactants.  This means that more NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> ions combine to form undissociated NH<sub>4</sub>OH.  As a result, the concentration of hydroxide ions ([OH<sup>-</sup>]) *decreases*.  Since pH is related to the concentration of hydroxide ions (or, more accurately, pOH = -log[OH<sup>-</sup>] and pH + pOH = 14), the pH of the solution will *decrease* (become less basic) compared to what it would be without the added NH<sub>4</sub>Cl.  The added common ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) has suppressed the ionization of the weak base (NH<sub>4</sub>OH).

**Why is this crucial in biological systems?**

Understanding the common ion effect is vital in biology because many biological processes are highly sensitive to pH changes. Buffer systems are critical for maintaining a stable pH in cells and bodily fluids. For example:

*   **Blood pH Regulation:** The blood contains several buffer systems, including the carbonic acid/bicarbonate (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) buffer. Changes in CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the blood can shift this equilibrium, affecting pH. Kidneys can adjust the levels of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the blood. This influences blood pH and uses the common ion effect to maintain a stable, healthy pH.
*   **Enzyme Activity:** Enzymes, the catalysts of biological reactions, function optimally within a narrow pH range. Buffers within cells and tissues prevent drastic pH fluctuations that could denature enzymes and disrupt metabolic pathways.
*   **Protein Structure:** The three-dimensional structure of proteins, which is essential for their function, is influenced by pH. Maintaining a stable pH is crucial for preserving protein structure and activity.

In essence, the common ion effect is a fundamental principle that helps biological systems maintain the delicate pH balance necessary for life. By understanding how adding a common ion can suppress the ionization of weak acids or bases in buffer solutions, we can better appreciate the importance of these buffers in regulating biological processes and maintaining homeostasis.

2.  Consider a scenario involving the dissolution of a gas (like NH3) in water. Describe the equilibrium that is established. Then, discuss how factors such as temperature and pressure will influence the solubility of the gas and subsequently affect the pH of the solution. Explain your reasoning with respect to Le Chatelier's principle.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 Chemistry student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content (keeping in mind the limited information available):

**Answer:**

When a gas like ammonia (NH3) dissolves in water, a dynamic equilibrium is established. The ammonia molecules interact with water molecules, forming ammonium ions (NH4+) and hydroxide ions (OH-).  This equilibrium can be represented as follows:

NH3 (g) + H2O (l)  ⇌  NH4+ (aq) + OH- (aq)

This equilibrium means that ammonia molecules are constantly dissolving into the water while ammonium and hydroxide ions are reforming ammonia and water at the same rate, resulting in a stable concentration of each species at a given set of conditions.

**Factors Affecting Solubility and pH:**

According to Le Chatelier's principle, if a change of condition is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system will shift in a direction that relieves the stress. In this case, the solubility of ammonia and therefore the pH of the solution is affected by temperature and pressure.

*   **Temperature:** The dissolution of most gases in water, including ammonia, is an exothermic process (releases heat). This means that we can think of "heat" as a product of the reaction:

    NH3 (g) + H2O (l)  ⇌  NH4+ (aq) + OH- (aq) + Heat

    Therefore, increasing the temperature adds "heat" to the system.  To relieve this stress, the equilibrium will shift to the *left*, favoring the reverse reaction. This means less NH3 will dissolve, decreasing the concentration of NH4+ and OH- ions in the solution. A decrease in OH- concentration means a lower pH (less alkaline). Therefore, *increasing temperature decreases the solubility of NH3 and lowers the pH of the solution.*

*   **Pressure:**  According to Henry's Law, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid.

    NH3 (g) + H2O (l)  ⇌  NH4+ (aq) + OH- (aq)

    Increasing the pressure of NH3 gas above the water, is a stress on the system. The system will relieve the stress by favoring the side with less gaseous molecules, which is the forward reaction. Therefore, more NH3 will dissolve, increasing the concentration of NH4+ and OH- ions in the solution. An increase in OH- concentration means a higher pH (more alkaline). Therefore, *increasing pressure increases the solubility of NH3 and raises the pH of the solution.*

**In Summary:**

The solubility of ammonia in water is influenced by both temperature and pressure. Lower temperatures and higher pressures favor increased solubility of NH3, leading to a higher concentration of OH- ions and consequently a higher pH. This behavior is consistent with Le Chatelier's principle, where the system adjusts to counteract the applied stress (temperature or pressure change) to re-establish equilibrium.

3.  A student attempts to determine the pH of a weak acid solution using only a universal indicator and a color chart. Discuss the limitations of this method compared to using a pH meter. Also, design a simple experiment to comparatively evaluate the buffer capacity of a solution containing a weak acid and its conjugate base versus a solution of strong acid with a similar pH. Outline the materials needed and the steps involved.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided (albeit limited) NCERT content, focusing on acid-base equilibria and buffer solutions.

**Answer:**

**Part 1: Limitations of Universal Indicator vs. pH Meter for Weak Acid pH Determination**

Using a universal indicator and a color chart to determine the pH of a weak acid solution has significant limitations compared to using a pH meter. These limitations stem from the subjective nature of color interpretation and the inherent accuracy of the measurement device.

*   **Subjectivity of Color Interpretation:** Universal indicators change color gradually across a range of pH values. The color chart provides a set of reference colors corresponding to specific pH values. However, matching the solution's color *exactly* to a color on the chart is often difficult and subjective. Different individuals may perceive the color slightly differently, leading to variations in the estimated pH. This is especially problematic with weak acids, where the pH change near the equivalence point is gradual.

*   **Limited Accuracy and Precision:** Color charts usually provide pH values in increments of 0.5 or 1 pH unit. This means that you can only estimate the pH to the nearest 0.5 or 1 unit. A pH meter, on the other hand, provides a digital readout with much higher precision (often to two or three decimal places). This greater precision is crucial for accurately determining the pH of weak acid solutions, particularly when studying their dissociation constants or buffering capacity. The pH meter gives a quantitative value, whereas the indicator gives a qualitative estimate.

*   **Interference from Colored or Turbid Solutions:** If the weak acid solution itself has a slight color or is slightly turbid (cloudy), it can interfere with the color of the indicator, making it even more difficult to determine the pH accurately. A pH meter is not affected by the solution's color or turbidity.

*   **Indicator Error:** The universal indicator itself is a weak acid or base. Adding it to the solution will slightly alter the pH of the solution, though this effect is usually small. A pH meter does not introduce any additional substances that can alter the pH.

In summary, while a universal indicator is useful for a rough estimate of pH, a pH meter provides a more accurate, precise, and objective measurement, especially for weak acid solutions.

**Part 2: Experiment to Evaluate Buffer Capacity**

Here's a simple experiment to compare the buffer capacity of a weak acid/conjugate base buffer versus a strong acid solution of similar pH.

**Objective:** To compare the resistance to pH change of a weak acid buffer and a strong acid solution when a small amount of strong base is added.

**Materials:**

*   **Solutions:**
    *   0.1 M Acetic Acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) - *Weak Acid*
    *   0.1 M Sodium Acetate (CH<sub>3</sub>COONa) - *Conjugate Base*
    *   0.05 M Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) - *Strong Acid*
    *   0.1 M Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) - *Strong Base (Titrant)*
    *   Distilled water
*   **Equipment:**
    *   pH meter and electrode
    *   Two 100 mL beakers
    *   Two 50 mL beakers
    *   Two 25 mL graduated cylinders
    *   Two Stirring rods
    *   Burette (50 mL)
    *   Burette stand and clamp
    *   Magnetic stirrer (optional)

**Procedure:**

1.  **Preparation of Buffer Solution:**
    *   In a 100 mL beaker, mix 25 mL of 0.1 M Acetic Acid and 25 mL of 0.1 M Sodium Acetate. This creates a buffer solution.
    *   Record the initial pH of the buffer solution using the pH meter.
2.  **Preparation of Strong Acid Solution:**
    *   In a separate 100 mL beaker, add 50mL of 0.05M Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) solution.
    *   Record the initial pH of the strong acid solution using the pH meter. Ensure the initial pH of the strong acid solution is reasonably close to that of the buffer solution.
3.  **Titration with Strong Base:**
    *   Fill the burette with 0.1 M NaOH solution.
    *   Place the beaker containing the buffer solution on a magnetic stirrer (or use a stirring rod).
    *   Add the NaOH solution from the burette in small increments (e.g., 0.5 mL or 1 mL), stirring continuously.
    *   After each addition of NaOH, record the pH of the buffer solution.
    *   Continue adding NaOH and recording the pH until the pH reaches approximately 12.
4.  **Repeat Titration with Strong Acid Solution:**
    *   Repeat step 3, but use the beaker containing the strong acid solution instead of the buffer solution.
5.  **Data Analysis:**
    *   Plot the pH versus the volume of NaOH added for both the buffer solution and the strong acid solution.
    *   Compare the graphs. The buffer solution will show a much smaller change in pH for a given amount of NaOH added, especially in the buffering region.
    *   Determine the buffer capacity by calculating the amount of strong base required to change the pH of the buffer solution by one unit (e.g., from pH 4 to pH 5).

**Expected Results and Conclusion:**

The pH of the strong acid solution will change much more rapidly upon the addition of NaOH than the pH of the buffer solution. The buffer solution will resist changes in pH because the acetic acid will react with the added hydroxide ions to form acetate ions and water, while the acetate ions will react with any added hydronium ions. This experiment demonstrates the buffering capacity of a weak acid/conjugate base system compared to a strong acid solution. The buffer solution will maintain a relatively stable pH over a larger range of added base.
