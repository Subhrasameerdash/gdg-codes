1.  **Conceptual Application:** A chemist is designing a novel battery using a redox couple not listed in standard reduction potential tables. Explain how they could experimentally determine the standard reduction potential (E°) of this new half-cell and why knowing this value is crucial for predicting the battery's overall voltage and feasibility.
Sample Answer:
Here's a model answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 Chemistry student:

**Answer:**

To experimentally determine the standard reduction potential (E°) of a novel half-cell (let's call it M<sup>n+</sup>/M) not found in standard tables, a chemist would typically use a setup involving a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and a voltmeter. Knowing this E° value is crucial for predicting the battery's overall voltage and feasibility because it dictates the cell's driving force and energy output.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

**1. Constructing the Electrochemical Cell:**

*   The chemist would construct an electrochemical cell consisting of the novel half-cell (M<sup>n+</sup>/M) and a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).  The SHE is defined as having a standard reduction potential of 0.00 V.

*   The half-cell would consist of an electrode made of the metal M immersed in a solution containing M<sup>n+</sup> ions at a concentration of 1 M under standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm pressure).

*   The SHE consists of a platinum electrode immersed in a 1 M solution of H<sup>+</sup> ions, with hydrogen gas bubbling through it at 1 atm pressure.

*   The two half-cells are connected via a salt bridge to allow ion flow and maintain electrical neutrality.

**2. Measuring the Cell Potential (E<sub>cell</sub>):**

*   A voltmeter is connected to the two electrodes. The voltmeter will measure the potential difference between the two half-cells, which is the cell potential (E<sub>cell</sub>).

**3. Determining the Standard Reduction Potential (E°) of the Novel Half-Cell:**

*   The cell potential (E<sub>cell</sub>) is related to the standard reduction potentials of the cathode (reduction half-cell) and anode (oxidation half-cell) by the following equation:

    E<sub>cell</sub> = E°<sub>cathode</sub> - E°<sub>anode</sub>

*   Since the SHE is used as a reference and its E° is 0.00 V, the determination of whether the novel half-cell acts as a cathode or anode is essential. This is determined by the voltage reading.

*   **Case 1: Novel Half-Cell is the Cathode (Reduction occurs at M<sup>n+</sup>/M):** If the voltmeter shows a positive reading, it means the novel half-cell is acting as the cathode (reduction is occurring there), and the SHE is acting as the anode (oxidation is occurring there). In this case:

    E<sub>cell</sub> = E°<sub>(M<sup>n+</sup>/M)</sub> - E°<sub>(SHE)</sub>

    E<sub>cell</sub> = E°<sub>(M<sup>n+</sup>/M)</sub> - 0.00 V

    Therefore, E°<sub>(M<sup>n+</sup>/M)</sub> = E<sub>cell</sub>

*   **Case 2: Novel Half-Cell is the Anode (Oxidation occurs at M<sup>n+</sup>/M):** If the voltmeter shows a negative reading, it means the novel half-cell is acting as the anode (oxidation is occurring there), and the SHE is acting as the cathode (reduction is occurring there). To get a positive E° value for the M<sup>n+</sup>/M reduction potential, we use:

    E<sub>cell</sub> = E°<sub>(SHE)</sub> - E°<sub>(M<sup>n+</sup>/M)</sub>

    E<sub>cell</sub> = 0.00 V - E°<sub>(M<sup>n+</sup>/M)</sub>

    Therefore, E°<sub>(M<sup>n+</sup>/M)</sub> = -E<sub>cell</sub>

*   By knowing the cell potential and the fact that the SHE has a standard reduction potential of 0.00 V, the chemist can calculate the standard reduction potential of the novel half-cell.

**Why knowing E° is Crucial:**

*   **Predicting Battery Voltage:**  When designing a battery, the overall voltage of the battery is determined by the difference in the standard reduction potentials of the two half-cells used.  Knowing the E° of the novel half-cell allows the chemist to pair it with another half-cell to achieve a desired voltage.  A larger difference in E° values between the two half-cells will result in a higher voltage.

*   **Determining Battery Feasibility (Spontaneity):** The standard cell potential (E°<sub>cell</sub>) is directly related to the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) for the overall redox reaction:

    ΔG° = -nFE°<sub>cell</sub>

    where:
    *   n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the balanced redox reaction.
    *   F is Faraday's constant (approximately 96,485 C/mol).

    A negative ΔG° indicates that the reaction is spontaneous (i.e., the battery will work). A positive E°<sub>cell</sub> will result in a negative ΔG°. Therefore, by knowing the E° of the novel half-cell and pairing it with another half-cell, the chemist can predict whether the overall redox reaction will be spontaneous and if the battery is feasible. If the E° difference results in a negative E°<sub>cell</sub>, the reaction is non-spontaneous, and the battery will not function.

*   **Understanding Redox Strength:** The E° value provides a quantitative measure of the oxidizing or reducing strength of the species in the half-cell. A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidizing agent (greater tendency to be reduced), while a more negative E° value indicates a stronger reducing agent (greater tendency to be oxidized). This knowledge is vital for optimizing the battery's performance and preventing unwanted side reactions.

In summary, experimentally determining the standard reduction potential of the novel half-cell is fundamental for predicting the battery's voltage, assessing its thermodynamic feasibility, and understanding the redox behavior of the involved chemical species, all of which are essential considerations for designing a functional and efficient battery.

2.  **Thermodynamic Reasoning:** Two compounds, A and B, have similar molar masses, but compound A has a significantly higher standard entropy (S°) than compound B. Describe three possible structural or physical differences between A and B that could explain this difference in entropy. Justify your reasoning based on the relationship between entropy and molecular properties.
Sample Answer:
Here's a sample answer appropriate for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the relationship between entropy and molecular properties:

**Answer:**

The standard entropy (S°) of a substance is a measure of the disorder or randomness within its system. A higher entropy value indicates a greater degree of molecular freedom and a larger number of possible microstates (arrangements of molecules). Given that compound A has a significantly higher standard entropy than compound B, despite having similar molar masses, the following structural or physical differences could explain this:

1.  **State of Matter/Phase:**  The most significant difference likely arises from the physical state of the two compounds at standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm). If compound A exists as a gas while compound B exists as a liquid or a solid, A will inherently have a much higher entropy. Gases have the highest entropy because their molecules have the greatest freedom of translational motion (moving from one place to another) and occupy a much larger volume. Liquids have more entropy than solids because their molecules have more translational and rotational freedom, although less than a gas. Solids have the lowest entropy, as their molecules are typically locked in a relatively rigid lattice structure, restricting their movement mainly to vibrations.

    *   **Justification:** Entropy increases with increasing molecular freedom. A change in state from solid to liquid to gas involves a significant increase in molecular freedom, hence a large increase in entropy.

2.  **Molecular Complexity and Vibrational Modes:** If both A and B are in the same physical state (e.g., both are liquids), differences in molecular complexity can contribute to the entropy difference. A more complex molecule (compound A) typically has more internal rotational and vibrational modes compared to a simpler molecule (compound B). More vibrational modes mean more ways to distribute energy within the molecule, leading to a greater number of possible microstates and, therefore, higher entropy. A molecule with more flexible bonds and a greater number of atoms has more ways to vibrate and rotate.

    *   **Justification:** Each vibrational and rotational mode contributes to the overall disorder of the system. More modes allow for a greater distribution of energy and a larger number of possible arrangements.

3.  **Crystal Structure/Intermolecular Forces (if both are solids):** If both A and B are solids, differences in their crystal structure and the strength of intermolecular forces can affect entropy. Compound A might have a less ordered crystal structure (e.g., amorphous rather than crystalline) or weaker intermolecular forces than compound B. Weaker intermolecular forces mean that the molecules in compound A have more freedom to move (vibrate) within the solid lattice compared to the strongly held molecules in compound B. A less ordered crystal structure directly implies more disorder and higher entropy.

    *   **Justification:** Stronger intermolecular forces restrict molecular motion, decreasing the number of available microstates. A more ordered crystal structure also limits the number of possible arrangements of molecules, lowering entropy.

In summary, the higher entropy of compound A compared to compound B, assuming similar molar masses, points to differences that increase molecular freedom and the number of accessible microstates. These differences could be related to the state of matter, molecular complexity, or the nature of the solid-state structure and intermolecular forces.

3.  **Problem-Solving with Unit Conversions and Enthalpy:** A student measures the heat released during the combustion of a small sample of ethanol (C2H5OH) in a calorimeter. The student records the heat released in calories (cal) and the mass of ethanol burned in milligrams (mg). Outline the steps the student needs to take to convert their experimental data into a standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔH°combustion) in kJ/mol, clearly stating the necessary conversion factors and the equations used.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student, addressing the assignment question using the provided NCERT appendix information.  It breaks down the process of converting experimental data to a standard enthalpy of combustion:

**Answer:**

To convert the experimental data from the calorimeter into a standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔH°combustion) in kJ/mol for ethanol, the student needs to follow these steps:

**1. Convert Heat Released from Calories (cal) to Joules (J):**

*   **Explanation:** The SI unit of energy is the Joule (J), so the initial step involves converting the heat released from calories to joules.
*   **Conversion Factor:** 1 cal = 4.184 J
*   **Equation:** Heat released in Joules (Q in J) = Heat released in calories (Q in cal) * 4.184 J/cal

**2. Convert Mass of Ethanol from Milligrams (mg) to Grams (g):**

*   **Explanation:** Molar mass is expressed in grams per mole (g/mol), so we need to convert the mass of ethanol burned from milligrams to grams.
*   **Conversion Factor:** 1 g = 1000 mg
*   **Equation:** Mass of ethanol in grams (m in g) = Mass of ethanol in milligrams (m in mg) / 1000 mg/g

**3. Calculate the Number of Moles of Ethanol Burned:**

*   **Explanation:** To determine the enthalpy change per mole, we need to find the number of moles of ethanol that were combusted.  We'll use the molar mass of ethanol for this calculation.
*   **Molar Mass of Ethanol (C2H5OH):** (2 * 12.01 g/mol (C)) + (6 * 1.01 g/mol (H)) + (1 * 16.00 g/mol (O)) = 46.08 g/mol (You would typically find this in a periodic table or a table of molar masses provided in the NCERT appendices)
*   **Equation:** Moles of ethanol (n) = Mass of ethanol in grams (m in g) / Molar mass of ethanol (M in g/mol)
    *   n = m / M

**4. Calculate the Heat Released per Mole of Ethanol (ΔH):**

*   **Explanation:** This step determines the enthalpy change for the combustion of one mole of ethanol.
*   **Equation:** Enthalpy change (ΔH in J/mol) = - (Heat released in Joules (Q in J) / Moles of ethanol (n))
    *   ΔH = -Q / n
    *   **Note the negative sign:** This is crucial because the calorimeter measures the heat *released* by the combustion.  Enthalpy of combustion is defined as the *negative* of the heat released at constant pressure (which is a good approximation for a calorimeter).

**5. Convert the Enthalpy Change from Joules per Mole (J/mol) to Kilojoules per Mole (kJ/mol):**

*   **Explanation:**  Standard enthalpies are typically expressed in kJ/mol.
*   **Conversion Factor:** 1 kJ = 1000 J
*   **Equation:** Enthalpy change in kJ/mol (ΔH in kJ/mol) = Enthalpy change in J/mol (ΔH in J/mol) / 1000 J/kJ

**6. Express the Result as Standard Enthalpy of Combustion (ΔH°combustion):**

*   **Explanation:**  The value calculated in step 5 is now the experimental enthalpy of combustion. If the experiment was conducted under standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm), then it can be directly reported as the standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔH°combustion). If the experiment was not conducted under standard conditions, a correction might be needed, but this is beyond the scope of a simple conversion problem.
*   **Report:** ΔH°combustion = ΔH (in kJ/mol)

**Summary of Steps and Equations:**

1.  Q (J) = Q (cal) * 4.184 J/cal
2.  m (g) = m (mg) / 1000 mg/g
3.  n (moles) = m (g) / M (g/mol), where M is the molar mass of ethanol (46.08 g/mol)
4.  ΔH (J/mol) = -Q (J) / n (moles)
5.  ΔH (kJ/mol) = ΔH (J/mol) / 1000 J/kJ
6.  ΔH°combustion = ΔH (kJ/mol)

**Important Notes:**

*   **Sign Convention:** Remember the negative sign in step 4. Combustion is an exothermic process, so ΔH°combustion should be a negative value.
*   **Units:** Pay close attention to the units in each step and ensure they cancel out correctly.
*   **Standard Conditions:** The standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔH°combustion) refers to the enthalpy change when the reaction is carried out under standard conditions (298 K and 1 atm pressure). Ensure you understand what "standard conditions" mean in the context of thermochemistry.

By following these steps and using the appropriate conversion factors, the student can accurately convert their experimental data into the standard enthalpy of combustion for ethanol in kJ/mol.
