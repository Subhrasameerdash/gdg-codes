**Answer:**

The wave-particle duality of matter, particularly as it applies to electrons, revolutionized our understanding of atomic structure by moving away from the fixed, well-defined orbits of earlier models like Bohr's model. Bohr's model, while a significant improvement over previous models, still treated electrons as particles moving in specific circular paths around the nucleus, much like planets orbiting the sun. This model successfully explained the hydrogen atom's spectrum but failed to accurately predict the behavior of more complex atoms.

The concept of wave-particle duality, stemming from de Broglie's hypothesis, suggests that electrons (and all matter, in fact) exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This means that electrons are not simply tiny balls orbiting the nucleus; they also behave as waves, characterized by wavelength and frequency. This wave nature is crucial to understanding their behavior within the atom.

This wave-like behavior is what led to the development of the quantum mechanical model of the atom. In this model, we no longer talk about fixed orbits but rather about *atomic orbitals*. An atomic orbital is a region of space around the nucleus where there is a high probability of finding an electron. It's a probability distribution, not a definite path.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle further solidifies this shift in understanding. This principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and the exact momentum (and thus velocity) of an electron with perfect accuracy. The more precisely we determine one, the less precisely we can know the other.

Therefore, because we can't know an electron's exact position and momentum at the same time, the idea of electrons following definite paths (like in Bohr's model) becomes meaningless. Instead, we must accept that electrons exist in regions of probability (orbitals) described by quantum numbers.

In summary, the wave-particle duality and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle forced a move from the deterministic view of Bohr's model (where electrons followed predictable paths) to a probabilistic view (where we can only describe the likelihood of finding an electron in a particular region of space). This led to the development of the quantum mechanical model, which provides a more accurate and complete description of atomic structure and behavior. The earlier models did not account for the limitations to understanding and describing the behaviours of electrons.

2.  **Application Question:** Imagine a newly discovered element, Element X, is found to have 7 electrons in its neutral atom.
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the provided assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT content and generated information:

**Question:** Imagine a newly discovered element, Element X, is found to have 7 electrons in its neutral atom.

a) Write the ground-state electronic configuration of Element X using both *spdf* notation and an orbital diagram.
b) How many unpaired electrons does Element X have in its ground state? Explain your reasoning.

**Answer:**

a) **Electronic Configuration of Element X (with 7 electrons):**

To determine the electronic configuration, we need to fill the orbitals according to the Aufbau principle, which states that electrons first occupy the lowest energy levels available. We also need to keep in mind the Pauli Exclusion Principle (each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins) and Hund's rule (electrons will individually occupy each orbital within a subshell before pairing up in any one orbital).

*   **spdf Notation:**

    1s² 2s² 2p³

    *Explanation:*
    *   We start by filling the 1s orbital, which can hold a maximum of 2 electrons (1s²).
    *   Next, we fill the 2s orbital, which also holds a maximum of 2 electrons (2s²).
    *   Now we have 3 electrons left. These go into the 2p subshell, which has three orbitals. Each of these orbitals can hold 2 electrons, but we only have 3 left.

*   **Orbital Diagram:**

    (1s)↑↓ (2s)↑↓ (2p)↑ ↑ ↑

    *Explanation:*
    *   Each box represents an orbital.
    *   Arrows represent electrons. An upward arrow (↑) indicates one spin, and a downward arrow (↓) indicates the opposite spin.
    *   Following Hund's rule, the three electrons in the 2p subshell each occupy a separate 2p orbital before any pairing occurs. This minimizes electron-electron repulsion.

b) **Number of Unpaired Electrons in Element X:**

Element X has **3 unpaired electrons**.

*Reasoning:*

Looking at the electronic configuration and orbital diagram, we see that the 1s and 2s orbitals are completely filled (each has two paired electrons).  However, in the 2p subshell, we have three electrons, each occupying a separate 2p orbital. According to Hund's rule, these electrons will remain unpaired until all the 2p orbitals have at least one electron. Therefore, Element X has three unpaired electrons in its ground state.

3.  **Comparative Analysis Question:** Compare and contrast the contributions and limitations of Thomson's plum pudding model and Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom. While both models advanced scientific understanding, what crucial experimental evidence led to the rejection of Thomson's model in favor of Rutherford's?
Sample Answer:
Okay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for CBSE Class 11-12 students, based on the provided chapter content and the generated summary/definitions/example.

**Answer:**

Both Thomson's plum pudding model and Rutherford's nuclear model were significant attempts to describe the structure of the atom, but they differed substantially in their proposed arrangements of subatomic particles and, ultimately, in their validity.

**Thomson's Plum Pudding Model:**

*   **Contribution:** Thomson's model, proposed after his discovery of the electron, was the first to suggest that the atom was divisible and contained negatively charged particles (electrons). It represented a departure from the earlier notion of indivisible atoms.
*   **Description:** The model envisioned the atom as a sphere of positive charge, with electrons embedded within it, much like plums in a pudding or raisins in a cake. The positive charge was diffuse and uniformly distributed.
*   **Limitation:** The major flaw of Thomson's model was its inability to explain the results of Rutherford's gold foil experiment. It predicted that alpha particles would pass through the atom with only minor deflections. It did not account for the presence of a concentrated positive charge within the atom.

**Rutherford's Nuclear Model:**

*   **Contribution:** Rutherford's model, developed based on the results of his alpha-particle scattering experiment, introduced the concept of a nucleus – a small, dense, positively charged region at the center of the atom.
*   **Description:** According to Rutherford, most of the atom's mass and all of its positive charge were concentrated in the nucleus. Electrons orbited the nucleus, similar to planets orbiting the sun. Most of the atom was empty space.
*   **Limitation:** Rutherford's model failed to explain the stability of the atom. According to classical physics, electrons orbiting the nucleus should continuously emit radiation, lose energy, and eventually spiral into the nucleus, causing the atom to collapse. It also did not explain the discrete line spectra observed for elements.

**Crucial Experimental Evidence for Rejection of Thomson's Model:**

The **alpha-particle scattering experiment (Gold Foil Experiment)** conducted by Rutherford and his colleagues was the decisive factor that led to the rejection of Thomson's model.

*   **Observations:** The experiment involved bombarding a thin gold foil with alpha particles (positively charged helium nuclei). The researchers observed that:
    *   Most alpha particles passed straight through the foil undeflected, suggesting that the atom was mostly empty space.
    *   A small fraction of alpha particles were deflected at small angles.
    *   A very few alpha particles (about 1 in 20,000) were deflected at very large angles or even bounced back in the direction from which they came.
*   **Interpretation:** These observations could not be explained by Thomson's model. The large-angle scattering indicated that the positive charge in the atom was concentrated in a very small volume (the nucleus), which exerted a strong repulsive force on the positively charged alpha particles. This contradicted Thomson's model, which predicted only minor deflections.

In conclusion, while Thomson's model was a valuable first step in understanding atomic structure, Rutherford's nuclear model, based on the experimental evidence from the alpha-particle scattering experiment, provided a more accurate representation of the atom and paved the way for further developments in atomic theory. The unexpected results of Rutherford's experiment directly contradicted the fundamental assumptions of the plum pudding model, leading to its rejection.
