8.  **Guidelines for SI Units:** Rules for using and writing SI unit symbols, prefixes, and combinations of units. This emphasizes the correct notation and avoids common errors.

9.  **Dimensional Formulae:** A table providing the dimensional formulas for various physical quantities, which are helpful for checking the consistency of equations.

### Definitions ###
Okay, here's a breakdown of what the appendices in this Physics NCERT chapter provide, along with some explanations and examples *without directly copying* from the text.

**Summary of the Appendices**

These appendices are like a physicist's toolbox and reference manual. They provide essential information that you'll use throughout your physics studies. Think of them as a quick-reference guide for:

*   **The Greek Alphabet:** Useful for when you encounter symbols in formulas that aren't standard English letters.
*   **SI Prefixes:** These help you express very large or very small numbers in a compact and easy-to-understand way (e.g., using "kilo" for thousands or "milli" for thousandths).
*   **Fundamental Constants:** These are physical quantities that are believed to be universal and unchanging (e.g., the speed of light, the gravitational constant).
*   **Conversion Factors:** These allow you to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., converting kilometers to miles or grams to kilograms).
*   **Mathematical Formulas:** A review of geometry, trigonometry, and algebra concepts that are frequently used in physics.
*   **SI Units:** These appendices list the base and derived units in the International System of Units (SI). They also provide guidelines on how to correctly use symbols for physical quantities, chemical elements, nuclides, and SI units and prefixes.
*   **Dimensional Formulae**: Provides an overview of dimensional formulae of physical quantities.

**Definitions of Key Concepts**

*   **Physical Constants:** These are numbers that represent fundamental quantities in the universe. For instance, the speed of light in a vacuum is a constant, always the same value, no matter how you measure it (approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second). They are used in equations to relate different physical quantities.
*   **Conversion Factor:** A ratio that expresses how many of one unit are equal to another unit. For example, knowing that 1 meter is equal to 3.28 feet allows you to convert any measurement in meters to its equivalent in feet by multiplying by the conversion factor (3.28 feet/1 meter).
*   **SI Units:** A standardized system of units used for scientific measurements. It's based on seven base units (e.g., meter for length, kilogram for mass, second for time), and all other units are derived from these. Using SI units ensures consistency and avoids confusion in scientific communication.
*   **Prefixes:** Shorthand notations that are added to units to indicate multiples or submultiples of that unit. For example, 'kilo' (k) means 1000, so 1 kilometer (km) is 1000 meters. 'Milli' (m) means 0.001, so 1 millisecond (ms) is 0.001 seconds.

**Solved Example (Using Conversion Factors)**

**Problem:** A car is traveling at a speed of 25 meters per second. What is its speed in kilometers per hour?

**Solution:**

1.  **Meters to Kilometers:** We know that 1 kilometer (km) is equal to 1000 meters (m).  So, to convert meters to kilometers, we divide by 1000.
    *   25 m * (1 km / 1000 m) = 0.025 km

2.  **Seconds to Hours:** We know that 1 hour (h) is equal to 3600 seconds (s). So, to convert seconds to hours, we divide by 3600
    * 1 s = (1/3600) h

3.  **Combine the Conversions:** Now, we combine both conversions to get the speed in kilometers per hour:

    *   0.  025 km/s * (3600 s / 1 h) = 90 km/h

**Answer:** The car's speed is 90 kilometers per hour.
