### Definitions ###
Okay, here's a breakdown of the chapter "Gravitation," focusing on clear definitions, a summary, and a solved example, explained simply:

**Chapter Summary**

This chapter explores gravity, starting with everyday observations like things falling to Earth. It moves through historical models of the universe (geocentric vs. heliocentric), Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and finally Newton's law of universal gravitation. You'll learn how gravity affects objects on Earth and celestial bodies, how to calculate gravitational forces, and concepts like gravitational potential energy and escape velocity. The chapter also touches upon Earth satellites and their energy.

**Key Definitions (Explained Simply)**

*   **Gravitation:** The force of attraction between any two objects with mass. The more mass and the closer they are, the stronger the attraction.

*   **Kepler's Laws:** Three rules describing planetary motion:
    1.  Planets move in ellipses (oval shapes) with the Sun at one focus.
    2.  A line connecting a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times (planets move faster when closer to the Sun).
    3.  The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit (larger orbits take longer).

*   **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:** Every object attracts every other object with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Expressed as: F = Gm1m2/r^2

    *   *G* is the gravitational constant.
    *   *m1* and *m2* are the masses of the two objects.
    *   *r* is the distance between their centers.

*   **Gravitational Constant (G):** A fundamental constant of nature that determines the strength of the gravitational force.

*   **Acceleration due to Gravity (g):** The acceleration experienced by an object due to the force of gravity. On Earth, it's approximately 9.8 m/s².

*   **Gravitational Potential Energy:** The energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field. It's the energy required to move an object from a point to infinity.

*   **Escape Speed:** The minimum speed an object needs to escape the gravitational pull of a planet or star and never return.

**Solved Example**

*Problem:*

A satellite of mass 500 kg orbits the Earth at a height of 300 km above the Earth's surface. Calculate:

1.  The orbital speed of the satellite.
2.  The period of revolution of the satellite.
3.  The total energy of the satellite.

*Given:*

*   G = 6.67 x 10^-11 Nm²/kg²
*   Mass of Earth (ME) = 6 x 10^24 kg
*   Radius of Earth (RE) = 6400 km = 6.4 x 10^6 m
*   Height (h) = 300 km = 3 x 10^5 m
*   Mass of satellite (m) = 500 kg

*Solution:*

1.  *Orbital Speed:*
    *   V = sqrt((G\*ME) / (RE + h))
    *   V = sqrt((6.67 x 10^-11 \* 6 x 10^24) / (6.4 x 10^6 + 3 x 10^5))
    *   V = sqrt((4.002 x 10^14) / (6.7 x 10^6))
    *   V = sqrt(5.97 x 10^7)
    *   V ≈ 7727 m/s

2.  *Period of Revolution:*
    *   T = (2 \* pi \* (RE + h)) / V
    *   T = (2 \* 3.14 \* (6.4 x 10^6 + 3 x 10^5)) / 7727
    *   T = (6.28 \* 6.7 x 10^6) / 7727
    *   T = 4.2076 x 10^7 / 7727
    *   T ≈ 5445 seconds

3.  *Total Energy:*
    *   E = - (G \* ME \* m) / (2 \* (RE + h))
    *   E = - (6.67 x 10^-11 \* 6 x 10^24 \* 500) / (2 \* (6.4 x 10^6 + 3 x 10^5))
    *   E = - (2.001 x 10^17) / (1.34 x 10^7)
    *   E ≈ -1.49 x 10^10 Joules

*Answer:*

1.  The orbital speed of the satellite is approximately 7727 m/s.
2.  The period of revolution of the satellite is approximately 5445 seconds.
3.  The total energy of the satellite is approximately -1.49 x 10^10 Joules.
