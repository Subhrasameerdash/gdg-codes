### Definitions ###
Okay, here's a breakdown of Chapter 14, "Waves," in simpler terms, avoiding direct copying and focusing on clear explanations:

**Summary:**

This chapter introduces mechanical waves, disturbances that propagate through a medium due to the oscillation of particles. It distinguishes between transverse (particle motion perpendicular to wave direction) and longitudinal (particle motion parallel to wave direction) waves. The chapter explains how to describe waves mathematically, including concepts like amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and speed. It also covers the superposition principle, wave reflection, standing waves, and the phenomenon of beats.

**Definitions:**

*   **Wave:** A disturbance that transfers energy through a medium (or space) without causing any permanent displacement of the medium itself. Think of it like ripples on a pond – the water doesn't move across the pond, but the disturbance does.
*   **Mechanical Wave:** A wave that requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel. The particles of the medium oscillate, transferring energy. Sound waves and water waves are examples.
*   **Transverse Wave:** A wave where the particles of the medium move perpendicular (at a right angle) to the direction the wave is traveling. A wave on a string is a good example – the string moves up and down, but the wave travels along the string.
*   **Longitudinal Wave:** A wave where the particles of the medium move back and forth in the same direction as the wave is traveling. Sound is a longitudinal wave – air molecules compress and expand along the direction the sound travels.
*   **Amplitude (a):** The maximum displacement of a particle in the medium from its resting (equilibrium) position. It basically describes how "big" the wave is.
*   **Wavelength (λ):** The distance between two identical points on a wave, like the distance between two crests (highest points) or two troughs (lowest points).
*   **Frequency (ν):** The number of complete wave cycles that pass a given point per unit of time (usually seconds). It's measured in Hertz (Hz).

**Solved Example:**

A string with a length of 2 m and a mass of 0.04 kg is fixed at both ends. If the tension in the string is 50 N, calculate the frequency of the fundamental mode of vibration.

1.  **Find the linear mass density:**
    *   μ = mass/length = 0.04 kg / 2 m = 0.02 kg/m

2.  **Calculate the speed of the wave on the string:**
    *   v = √(T/μ) = √(50 N / 0.02 kg/m) = √2500 m²/s² = 50 m/s

3.  **Determine the wavelength of the fundamental mode:**
    *   For the fundamental mode, λ = 2L = 2 * 2 m = 4 m

4.  **Calculate the fundamental frequency:**
    *   f = v/λ = (50 m/s) / (4 m) = 12.5 Hz
