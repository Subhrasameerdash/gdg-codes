**Chapter Summary: Thermodynamics**

Thermodynamics studies energy transformations and relationships between heat, work, and internal energy. It helps us predict whether a process will occur spontaneously and to what extent a reaction will proceed. Key concepts include systems and surroundings, internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. The laws of thermodynamics provide a framework for understanding energy conservation and the direction of spontaneous change.

**Definitions**

*   **System:** The specific part of the universe we're interested in observing (e.g., a reaction in a beaker).

*   **Surroundings:** Everything else in the universe *outside* the system.

*   **Internal Energy (U):** The total energy stored within a system (kinetic and potential energy of all its molecules). We usually focus on *changes* in internal energy (ΔU).

*   **Work (w):** Energy transferred when a force causes displacement (e.g., a gas expanding and pushing against a piston).

*   **Heat (q):** Energy transferred due to a temperature difference between the system and surroundings.

*   **Enthalpy (H):** A state function that combines internal energy, pressure, and volume (H = U + pV). Useful for reactions at constant pressure. The change in enthalpy (ΔH) tells us if a reaction is exothermic (releases heat, ΔH < 0) or endothermic (absorbs heat, ΔH > 0).

*   **State Function:** A property that depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not on the path taken to get there (e.g., internal energy, enthalpy, volume, temperature).

*   **Entropy (S):** A measure of the disorder or randomness of a system.  Spontaneous processes tend to increase the overall entropy of the universe.

*   **Gibbs Free Energy (G):** A thermodynamic potential that combines enthalpy and entropy (G = H - TS). The change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) predicts the spontaneity of a process at constant temperature and pressure:
    *   ΔG < 0: Spontaneous
    *   ΔG > 0: Non-spontaneous
    *   ΔG = 0: Equilibrium

*   **Standard State:** A defined set of conditions (usually 298 K and 1 bar pressure) used as a reference point for thermodynamic properties.

*   **Hess's Law:** The enthalpy change for a reaction is independent of the path taken; it only depends on the initial and final states.  This allows us to calculate enthalpy changes for reactions that are difficult to measure directly.

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:**

Consider the reaction:  N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g)

Given the following data:

*   ΔfH°[NH3(g)] = -46 kJ/mol

*   S°[N2(g)] = 192 J/mol·K

*   S°[H2(g)] = 131 J/mol·K

*   S°[NH3(g)] = 193 J/mol·K

Calculate ΔG° at 298 K and determine if the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate ΔH°**

ΔH° = Σ(n * ΔfH°[products]) - Σ(n * ΔfH°[reactants])

ΔH° = [2 * (-46 kJ/mol)] - [1 * (0 kJ/mol) + 3 * (0 kJ/mol)] = -92 kJ/mol

(Note: ΔfH° of elements in their standard state is zero)

**Step 2: Calculate ΔS°**

ΔS° = Σ(n * S°[products]) - Σ(n * S°[reactants])

ΔS° = [2 * (193 J/mol·K)] - [1 * (192 J/mol·K) + 3 * (131 J/mol·K)]

ΔS° = 386 J/mol·K - (192 J/mol·K + 393 J/mol·K) = -199 J/mol·K

**Step 3: Calculate ΔG°**

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°

ΔG° = -92 kJ/mol - (298 K * -0.199 kJ/mol·K)
ΔG° = -92 kJ/mol + 59.3 kJ/mol = -32.7 kJ/mol

**Step 4: Determine spontaneity**

Since ΔG° is negative (-32.7 kJ/mol), the reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions at 298 K.
