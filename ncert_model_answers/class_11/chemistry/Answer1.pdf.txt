### Definitions ###
Okay, I will create some educational content based on the provided NCERT answer key snippets, focusing on key concepts in chemistry.

**Summary**

This section appears to be from the answer key of a chemistry textbook, likely for Class XI. It covers a range of topics from basic calculations involving scientific notation and significant figures to stoichiometry, limiting reactants, empirical and molecular formulas, atomic structure, equilibrium, and acid-base concepts. The problems require applying fundamental chemical principles to solve numerical problems. Logarithms and antilogarithms are used extensively.

**Definitions**

*   **Limiting Reactant:** In a chemical reaction, the limiting reactant is the reactant that is completely consumed first. This determines the maximum amount of product that can be formed. Once the limiting reactant is used up, the reaction stops, regardless of how much of the other reactants are present.
*   **Empirical Formula:** The empirical formula of a compound is the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element present in the compound. It represents the smallest ratio of elements in a compound.
*   **Molecular Formula:** The molecular formula of a compound shows the actual number of atoms of each element present in a molecule of the compound. It is a multiple of the empirical formula.
*   **Equilibrium Constant (Kc):** For a reversible reaction at equilibrium, the equilibrium constant (Kc) is the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation. It indicates the extent to which a reaction will proceed to completion.
*   **pH:** pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration \[pH = -log10[H+]]. A pH of 7 is neutral, less than 7 is acidic, and greater than 7 is basic.

**Solved Example**

**Problem:**

A compound contains 40% carbon, 6.67% hydrogen, and 53.33% oxygen by mass. Find the empirical formula of the compound.

**Solution:**

1.  **Convert percentages to grams:** Assume we have 100 g of the compound. Then we have 40 g of C, 6.67 g of H, and 53.33 g of O.

2.  **Convert grams to moles:** Divide the mass of each element by its molar mass:

    *   Moles of C = 40 g / 12.01 g/mol = 3.33 mol
    *   Moles of H = 6.67 g / 1.008 g/mol = 6.62 mol
    *   Moles of O = 53.33 g / 16.00 g/mol = 3.33 mol

3.  **Find the simplest whole-number ratio:** Divide each mole value by the smallest mole value (3.33 in this case):

    *   C: 3.33 / 3.33 = 1
    *   H: 6.62 / 3.33 = 1.99 ≈ 2
    *   O: 3.33 / 3.33 = 1

4.  **Write the empirical formula:** The simplest whole-number ratio is C1H2O1, so the empirical formula is CH2O.

**Solved Example (Stoichiometry and Limiting Reactant):**

**Problem:**

Suppose you react 10.0 g of nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) with 3.0 g of hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) to produce ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>).

N<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2NH<sub>3</sub>(g)

(a) Which reactant is the limiting reactant?
(b) What mass of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) can be produced?
(c) What mass of the excess reactant will remain after the reaction is complete?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Convert grams to moles.**

*   Moles of N<sub>2</sub> = (10.0 g) / (28.02 g/mol) = 0.357 mol
*   Moles of H<sub>2</sub> = (3.0 g) / (2.02 g/mol) = 1.49 mol

**Step 2: Determine the mole ratio required by the balanced equation.**

*   From the balanced equation, 1 mole of N<sub>2</sub> reacts with 3 moles of H<sub>2</sub>.

**Step 3: Determine the limiting reactant.**

*   If all the N<sub>2</sub> reacts, we need (0.357 mol N<sub>2</sub>) * (3 mol H<sub>2</sub> / 1 mol N<sub>2</sub>) = 1.07 mol H<sub>2</sub>.  We have 1.49 mol of H<sub>2</sub>, which is more than we need.
*   If all the H<sub>2</sub> reacts, we need (1.49 mol H<sub>2</sub>) * (1 mol N<sub>2</sub> / 3 mol H<sub>2</sub>) = 0.497 mol N<sub>2</sub>.  We only have 0.357 mol of N<sub>2</sub>, which isn't enough.
*   Therefore, N<sub>2</sub> is the limiting reactant.

**Step 4: Calculate the mass of ammonia produced.**

*   From the balanced equation, 1 mole of N<sub>2</sub> produces 2 moles of NH<sub>3</sub>.
*   Moles of NH<sub>3</sub> produced = (0.357 mol N<sub>2</sub>) * (2 mol NH<sub>3</sub> / 1 mol N<sub>2</sub>) = 0.714 mol NH<sub>3</sub>
*   Mass of NH<sub>3</sub> produced = (0.714 mol) * (17.03 g/mol) = 12.16 g

**Step 5: Calculate the mass of excess reactant remaining.**

*   Moles of H<sub>2</sub> used = (0.357 mol N<sub>2</sub>) * (3 mol H<sub>2</sub> / 1 mol N<sub>2</sub>) = 1.07 mol H<sub>2</sub>
*   Moles of H<sub>2</sub> remaining = 1.49 mol - 1.07 mol = 0.42 mol
*   Mass of H<sub>2</sub> remaining = (0.42 mol) * (2.02 g/mol) = 0.85 g

**Answers:**

(a) Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) is the limiting reactant.
(b) 12.16 g of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) can be produced.
(c) 0.85 g of hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) will remain unreacted.
