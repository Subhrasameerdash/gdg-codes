### Summary ###
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided NCERT appendix information in a way that's hopefully easy to understand.

**Summary:**

This section of the NCERT book provides essential reference data for chemistry students. It includes definitions of the seven base SI units (metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela) according to current standards based on fundamental physical constants. Furthermore, it offers tables of data such as the molar masses of elements, specific and molar heat capacities, thermodynamic properties of various inorganic and organic substances (enthalpy of formation, Gibbs energy of formation, and entropy), physical constants, common unit conversions, and standard reduction potentials. These appendices serve as a convenient resource for solving numerical problems and understanding chemical concepts.

**Definitions in Simple Terms:**

*   **SI Base Units:** These are the fundamental units of measurement in the International System of Units (SI). Instead of being based on physical objects (like a specific metal bar), they are now defined using fixed numerical values of fundamental physical constants. This makes them more stable and universally accessible.
    *   **Metre (m):** The SI unit for length, defined using the speed of light.
    *   **Kilogram (kg):** The SI unit for mass, defined using the Planck constant.
    *   **Second (s):** The SI unit for time, defined using the caesium frequency.
    *   **Ampere (A):** The SI unit for electric current, defined using the elementary charge.
    *   **Kelvin (K):** The SI unit for thermodynamic temperature, defined using the Boltzmann constant.
    *   **Mole (mol):** The SI unit for the amount of substance, defined by Avogadro's number.
    *   **Candela (cd):** The SI unit for luminous intensity, defined by the luminous efficacy of radiation.
*   **Molar Mass:** The mass of one mole of a substance (element or compound), usually expressed in grams per mole (g/mol).
*   **Specific Heat Capacity:** The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Celsius (or one Kelvin).
*   **Molar Heat Capacity:** The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of one mole of a substance by one degree Celsius (or one Kelvin).
*   **Enthalpy of Formation (ΔfH°):** The change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.
*   **Gibbs Free Energy of Formation (ΔfG°):** The change in Gibbs free energy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. It indicates the spontaneity of the reaction.
*   **Entropy (S°):** A measure of the disorder or randomness of a system.
*   **Standard Reduction Potential (E°):** A measure of the tendency of a chemical species to be reduced, measured in volts (V) under standard conditions.

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:** Calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the combustion of methane (CH4) given the following standard enthalpies of formation:

*   ΔfH°(CO2(g)) = -393.5 kJ/mol
*   ΔfH°(H2O(l)) = -285.8 kJ/mol
*   ΔfH°(CH4(g)) = -74.8 kJ/mol

**Solution:**

1.  **Write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of methane:**

    CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)

2.  **Use the formula:**

    ΔH°reaction = Σ ΔfH°(products) - Σ ΔfH°(reactants)

3.  **Plug in the values:**

    ΔH°reaction = \[ΔfH°(CO2(g)) + 2 * ΔfH°(H2O(l))] - \[ΔfH°(CH4(g)) + 2 * ΔfH°(O2(g))]

    Remember that the standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state (like O2(g)) is zero.

    ΔH°reaction = \[-393.5 kJ/mol + 2 * (-285.8 kJ/mol)] - \[-74.8 kJ/mol + 2 * (0 kJ/mol)]

4.  **Calculate:**

    ΔH°reaction = \[-393.5 kJ/mol - 571.6 kJ/mol] - \[-74.8 kJ/mol]

    ΔH°reaction = -965.1 kJ/mol + 74.8 kJ/mol

    ΔH°reaction = -890.3 kJ/mol

**Answer:** The standard enthalpy change for the combustion of methane is -890.3 kJ/mol.

Okay, here's some educational content based on the provided NCERT appendices, focusing on clear explanations and a solved example:

**Summary**

These appendices provide crucial reference data for chemistry calculations. They define the SI base units (meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela) and list essential information like:

*   Atomic number and molar mass of elements.
*   Specific and molar heat capacities of substances.
*   Physical constants (Avogadro's number, Planck's constant, speed of light, etc.).
*   Common unit conversions for mass, volume, energy, length, force, pressure, and temperature.
*   Thermodynamic data (enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, entropy) for inorganic and organic substances.
*   Standard reduction potentials.

Understanding these units, constants, and data is fundamental for solving quantitative chemistry problems.

**Definitions (Explained Simply)**

*   **SI Base Units:** These are the fundamental units of measurement in the International System of Units (SI). Think of them as the building blocks for all other units. For example, the *meter* measures length, the *kilogram* measures mass, and the *second* measures time. All other units can be derived by combining these.

*   **Mole (mol):** A mole is a specific *amount* of a substance. It's like saying "a dozen," but instead of 12, a mole represents a *very* large number (Avogadro's number: 6.022 x 10^23) of particles (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.).

*   **Molar Mass:** The molar mass of a substance is the mass of *one mole* of that substance, usually expressed in grams per mole (g/mol).  It's numerically equal to the atomic or molecular weight in atomic mass units (amu).

*   **Enthalpy of Formation (ΔfH°):** The change in heat when *one mole* of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states (usually at 298 K and 1 atm). A negative value indicates heat is released (exothermic), and a positive value indicates heat is absorbed (endothermic).

*   **Gibbs Free Energy of Formation (ΔfG°):** This tells you whether a compound will *spontaneously* form from its elements under standard conditions. A negative value means the formation is spontaneous.

*   **Entropy (S°):** A measure of the *disorder* or randomness of a system. Higher entropy means more disorder.

*   **Standard Reduction Potential (E°):** A measure of the tendency of a chemical species to be *reduced* (gain electrons). It's measured in volts (V) relative to a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). A more positive E° means the species is more easily reduced (a stronger oxidizing agent).

**Solved Example**

**Problem:** Calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the combustion of methane (CH4) under standard conditions.

**Given:**

*   ΔfH°(CH4(g)) = -74.81 kJ/mol
*   ΔfH°(CO2(g)) = -393.51 kJ/mol
*   ΔfH°(H2O(l)) = -285.83 kJ/mol

**Combustion Reaction:**

CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)

**Solution:**

1.  **Formula:**  ΔH°reaction = ΣΔfH°(products) - ΣΔfH°(reactants)

2.  **Apply the Formula:**

    *   ΔH°reaction = [ΔfH°(CO2(g)) + 2\*ΔfH°(H2O(l))] - [ΔfH°(CH4(g)) + 2\*ΔfH°(O2(g))]

3.  **Remember:** The enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state (like O2(g)) is zero.  So, ΔfH°(O2(g)) = 0 kJ/mol

4.  **Substitute the Values:**

    *   ΔH°reaction = [(-393.51 kJ/mol) + 2\*(-285.83 kJ/mol)] - [(-74.81 kJ/mol) + 2\*(0 kJ/mol)]

5.  **Calculate:**

    *   ΔH°reaction = [-393.51 - 571.66] - [-74.81]
    *   ΔH°reaction = -965.17 + 74.81
    *   ΔH°reaction = -890.36 kJ/mol

**Answer:** The enthalpy change for the combustion of methane under standard conditions is -890.36 kJ/mol. This is an exothermic reaction, meaning heat is released.
