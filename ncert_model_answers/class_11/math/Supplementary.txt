### Summary ###
Okay, here's a breakdown of the concepts from the provided NCERT material, explained in a way that avoids direct copying and is suitable for educational purposes:

**1. Infinite Geometric Progressions (G.P.) and Their Sum**

*   **What it is:** An infinite G.P. is simply a geometric progression (a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous one by a constant ratio) that goes on forever.  For example: 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8,...

*   **Sum to Infinity:**  The cool thing is that sometimes, even though you're adding infinitely many terms, the sum approaches a finite number.  This happens when the common ratio (r) between terms is between -1 and 1 (i.e., its absolute value is less than 1: |r| < 1).

*   **Formula:** If |r| < 1, the sum to infinity (S<sub>∞</sub>) of a G.P. is given by:

    S<sub>∞</sub> = a / (1 - r)

    where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.

**2. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions and Limits**

*   **Exponential Function:** The exponential function, *e*<sup>x</sup>, is a function where *e* (Euler's number, approximately 2.71828) is raised to the power of *x*. The domain is all real numbers, and the range is all positive real numbers.

*   **Logarithmic Function:** The logarithmic function, log<sub>*e*</sub>(*x*) or ln(*x*) , is the inverse of the exponential function. It asks the question: "To what power must we raise *e* to get *x*?".  The domain is all positive real numbers, and the range is all real numbers.

*   **Key Limits:** Two important limits involving these functions are:

    *   lim<sub>x→0</sub> (*e*<sup>x</sup> - 1) / *x* = 1
    *   lim<sub>x→0</sub> ln(1 + *x*) / *x* = 1

    These limits are fundamental for calculus involving exponential and logarithmic functions.

**Solved Example (Infinite G.P.):**

**Problem:** Find the sum to infinity of the geometric progression: 3, 1, 1/3, 1/9, ...

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify 'a' and 'r':**
    *   The first term, a = 3
    *   The common ratio, r = 1/3 (because 1/3 * 3 = 1, 1/3 * 1= 1/3, and so on)

2.  **Check |r| < 1:**
    *   |1/3| < 1, so we *can* use the sum to infinity formula.

3.  **Apply the formula:**
    *   S<sub>∞</sub> = a / (1 - r) = 3 / (1 - 1/3) = 3 / (2/3) = 3 * (3/2) = 9/2 = 4.5

**Therefore, the sum to infinity of the G.P. 3, 1, 1/3, 1/9, ... is 4.5**

### Definitions ###
Okay, here's a breakdown of the concepts, definitions, and an example problem related to infinite geometric progressions and exponential/logarithmic limits, explained in a way suitable for NCERT-level understanding:

**Summary**

This section covers two main ideas:

1.  **Infinite Geometric Progressions (G.P.):**  We explore what happens when you add up *infinite* terms of a G.P.  Sometimes, this sum approaches a specific value (if the common ratio is between -1 and 1). We learn how to calculate this sum to infinity.

2.  **Limits of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:** We look at how exponential functions (like *e*<sup>*x*</sup>) and logarithmic functions (like log<sub>e</sub> *x*, also written as ln *x*) behave as *x* approaches certain values, especially 0. We use important standard limits to evaluate more complex limit problems involving these functions.

**Definitions**

*   **Infinite Geometric Progression:** A geometric progression is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant value (the common ratio, *r*). An infinite G.P. is simply a G.P. that goes on forever.  For example: 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ... is an infinite G.P. with *r* = 1/2.

*   **Sum to Infinity (S<sub>∞</sub>):**  If the absolute value of the common ratio *r* is less than 1 (i.e., -1 < *r* < 1), then the sum of an infinite G.P. approaches a finite value.  This value is called the sum to infinity and is calculated as:

    S<sub>∞</sub> = a / (1 - r)

    where 'a' is the first term of the G.P.

*   **The Number 'e':** This is a special irrational number, approximately equal to 2.71828. It's the base of the natural logarithm and appears frequently in calculus and exponential functions.

*   **Exponential Function:** A function of the form f(x) = e<sup>x</sup>, where 'e' is the base and 'x' is the exponent. Its graph increases rapidly as x increases.

*   **Logarithmic Function:** The inverse of the exponential function.  The natural logarithm, denoted as ln(x) or log<sub>e</sub>(x), answers the question: "To what power must I raise 'e' to get x?".  Its graph increases slowly as x increases.

*   **Limit:** The value that a function "approaches" as the input (x) approaches some value.

*   **Standard Limits:** These are pre-established limit results that are used to solve problems. Two important standard limits covered here are:

    *   lim<sub>x→0</sub> (e<sup>x</sup> - 1) / x = 1
    *   lim<sub>x→0</sub> ln(1 + x) / x = 1

**Solved Example**

**Problem:** Find the sum to infinity of the geometric progression: 4, -2, 1, -1/2, ...

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify 'a' and 'r':**
    *   The first term, *a*, is 4.
    *   The common ratio, *r*, is found by dividing any term by its preceding term.  For example, r = -2 / 4 = -1/2.

2.  **Check if |r| < 1:**
    *   The absolute value of *r* is |-1/2| = 1/2, which is less than 1. So, we *can* find the sum to infinity.

3.  **Apply the formula:**
    *   S<sub>∞</sub> = a / (1 - r) = 4 / (1 - (-1/2)) = 4 / (1 + 1/2) = 4 / (3/2) = 4 * (2/3) = 8/3

Therefore, the sum to infinity of the given geometric progression is 8/3.
