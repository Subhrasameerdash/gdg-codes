### Summary ###
In this Chapter, we studied about relations and functions.The main features of

### Definitions ###
Definition 1 Given two non-empty sets P and Q. The cartesian product P × Q is the
of the cartesian product,
of equality of ordered pairs, the pair (a, r) is not equal to the pair
(r, a), we conclude that P × Q ≠ Q × P.
of the intersection of two sets, (B ∩ C) = {4}.
2 A relation R from a non-empty set A to a non-empty set B is a subset of
3 The set of all first elements of the ordered pairs in a relation R from a set
4 The set of all second elements in a relation R from a set A to a set B is
of the relation,
5 A relation f from a set A to a set B is said to be a function if every
6 A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range is called
of [x], we
