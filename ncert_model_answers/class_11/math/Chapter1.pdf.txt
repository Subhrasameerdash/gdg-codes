### Summary ###
This chapter deals with some basic definitions and operations involving sets. These

### Definitions ###
1 A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set or the
2 A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is
3 Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same
4 A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an
that every set A is a subset of itself, i.e.,
5 The union of two sets A and B is the set C which consists of all those
6 The intersection of two sets A and B
of
7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of
of the complement that for any subset of the universal

Find the pairs of equal sets, if any, give reasons:
Which of the following pairs of sets are equal? Justify your answer.
(i)
Consider the sets
φ, A = { 1, 3 },   B = {1, 5, 9},   C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.
Let A = { a, e, i, o, u} and B = { a, b, c, d}. Is A a subset of B ? No.
(Why?). Is B a subset of  A? No. (Why?)
Let A, B and C be three sets. If A ∈ B and B ⊂ C, is it true that
Solution  No. Let A = {1}, B  = {{1}, 2} and C = {{1}, 2, 3}. Here A ∈ B as A = {1}
, if A = (–3, 5) and B = [–7, 9], then A ⊂ B. The set [ 0, ∞)
Let A = { 2, 4, 6, 8} and B = { 6, 8, 10, 12}. Find A ∪ B.
Let A = { a, e, i, o, u } and B = { a, i, u }. Show that A ∪ B  = A

Consider the sets A and B of Example 12. Find A ∩ B.
Consider the sets X and Y of Example 14. Find X ∩ Y.
Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and B = { 2, 3, 5, 7 }. Find A  ∩ B and
Let A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, B = { 2, 4, 6, 8 }. Find A – B and B – A.
Let V = { a, e, i, o, u } and
Let U =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Find A′.
Let U be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational
above, we have  A′ = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }

List all the subsets of the set { –1, 0, 1 }.
Show that A ∪  B =  A ∩ B implies  A = B
