### Summary ###
**Summary:**

This chapter expands on sequences and series, focusing on *infinite series*. It introduces the binomial theorem for any index (not just positive integers), leading to binomial series. The chapter then explores infinite geometric series, including how to find their sum when the common ratio's absolute value is less than 1. Finally, it introduces exponential and logarithmic series, providing formulas and examples for their use.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Infinite Series:** The sum of an infinite sequence of numbers.
*   **Binomial Theorem (Any Index):** An extension of the binomial theorem that allows for non-integer exponents, resulting in an infinite series.
*   **Infinite Geometric Series:** A geometric series with an infinite number of terms. It has a sum only when the absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1.
*   **Exponential Series:** A specific infinite series whose sum is the number *e* raised to a power.
*   **Logarithmic Series:** An infinite series representation of the natural logarithm function.

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:** Find the sum to infinity of the geometric progression 
6, 2, 2/3, ...

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify 'a' and 'r':** The first term, *a*, is 6. The common ratio, *r*, is found by dividing any term by its preceding term (e.g., 2 / 6 = 1/3).  So, r = 1/3.

2.  **Check |r| < 1:** Since |1/3| < 1, the infinite geometric series has a finite sum.

3.  **Apply the formula:** The sum to infinity (S) is given by S = a / (1 - r).

4.  **Substitute and calculate:** S = 6 / (1 - 1/3) = 6 / (2/3) = 6 * (3/2) = 9.

**Therefore, the sum to infinity of the given geometric progression is 9.**

### Definitions ###
Okay, here's a breakdown of the Infinite Series chapter, explained simply:

**Summary:**

This chapter expands on sequences and series, specifically looking at *infinite* series. It introduces the binomial theorem for any index (not just positive integers), infinite geometric series, exponential series, and logarithmic series. These are special types of infinite series with specific formulas and conditions for their use.

**Definitions:**

*   **Infinite Series:** An infinite series is the sum of all the terms in an infinite sequence. It's written like a1 + a2 + a3 + ... going on forever.
*   **Binomial Theorem (Generalized):** This is a way to expand expressions like (1 + x)^m when 'm' is *any* number (positive, negative, fraction), not just a positive whole number. The result is an infinite series, but it's only valid when the absolute value of 'x' is less than 1 ( |x| < 1).
*   **Infinite Geometric Series:** This is the sum of an infinite geometric sequence (where each term is multiplied by a constant 'r' to get the next term).  It has a special formula to find its sum *only* if the absolute value of the common ratio 'r' is less than 1 ( |r| < 1).
*   **Exponential Series:** A specific infinite series that defines the number 'e' (Euler's number, approximately 2.718) and can be generalized to represent e^x.
*   **Logarithmic Series:** An infinite series that represents the natural logarithm of (1 + x), denoted as loge(1 + x), valid for |x| < 1.

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:** Find the sum to infinity of the geometric progression: 9, 3, 1, 1/3, ...

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify 'a' and 'r':**
    *   The first term, a = 9.
    *   The common ratio, r = 3/9 = 1/3.

2.  **Check the condition for the sum to infinity:**
    *   |r| = |1/3| = 1/3, which is less than 1. So, we *can* use the formula.

3.  **Apply the formula:**
    *   Sum to infinity (S) = a / (1 - r)
    *   S = 9 / (1 - 1/3)
    *   S = 9 / (2/3)
    *   S = 9 * (3/2)
    *   S = 27/2 = 13.5

Therefore, the sum to infinity of the given geometric progression is 13.5.
