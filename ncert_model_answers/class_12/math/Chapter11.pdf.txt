### Summary ###
® Direction cosines of a line are the cosines of the angles made by the line

### Definitions ###
Okay, here's a breakdown of the key concepts from the Three-Dimensional Geometry chapter, explained simply and with an original example:

**Summary:**

This chapter bridges vector algebra with 3D geometry. It explains how to represent lines in space using direction cosines/ratios and vector equations. It covers finding equations of lines given a point and direction or two points. Also, calculating angles between lines, and the shortest distance between lines (including skew lines) is discussed.

**Definitions:**

*   **Direction Cosines:** Imagine a line in 3D space. The direction cosines are the cosines of the angles this line makes with the x, y, and z axes. They tell you the line's orientation.

*   **Direction Ratios:** These are any three numbers proportional to the direction cosines. They also define the line's direction, but aren't unique (you can scale them).

*   **Vector Equation of a Line:** A way to represent a line using vectors. It's like saying, "Start at a point *a*, then move along direction *b* by some amount *lambda*." Expressed as **r = a + λb**

*   **Skew Lines:** Lines in space that are neither parallel nor intersecting. Imagine two roads on different overpasses that never meet.

*   **Shortest Distance:** The shortest distance between skew lines is found along a line perpendicular to both.

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:** Find the vector equation of the line passing through the point (2, -1, 3) and parallel to the vector **i** - 2**j** + **k**. Then, find the Cartesian equation of this line.

**Solution:**

1.  **Vector Equation:**
    *   Let **a** = 2**i** - **j** + 3**k** (position vector of the point).
    *   Let **b** = **i** - 2**j** + **k** (the parallel vector).
    *   The vector equation is **r** = **a** + λ**b** = (2**i** - **j** + 3**k**) + λ(**i** - 2**j** + **k**).

2.  **Cartesian Equation:**
    *   From the vector equation, we can write:
        *   x = 2 + λ
        *   y = -1 - 2λ
        *   z = 3 + λ

    *   Solve each for λ:
        *   λ = x - 2
        *   λ = (y + 1) / -2
        *   λ = z - 3
    *   Equate the expressions for λ:

    **(x - 2) / 1 = (y + 1) / -2 = (z - 3) / 1**
