### Definitions ###
Okay, here's a breakdown of the chapter on Integrals, focusing on clear definitions, a summary, and a new example:

**Summary:**

This chapter introduces integral calculus, the inverse process of differentiation. It covers:

*   **Indefinite Integrals:** Finding antiderivatives of functions.
*   **Techniques of Integration:** Substitution, partial fractions, and integration by parts.
*   **Definite Integrals:** Calculating the area under a curve between specified limits.
*   **Fundamental Theorems of Calculus:** Connecting differentiation and integration.

**Definitions:**

*   **Integration:** Finding a function (the integral) whose derivative is a given function. Think of it as going *backward* from a derivative to the original function.
*   **Indefinite Integral:** The *family* of all possible antiderivatives of a function. Because the derivative of a constant is zero, we add "+ C" (the constant of integration) to account for all possibilities.
*   **Definite Integral:** A *number* representing the area under a curve between two specific points (limits) on the x-axis.
*   **Antiderivative:** A function whose derivative is the given function.
*   **Integrand:** The function being integrated.
*   **Substitution:** A technique for simplifying integrals by replacing part of the integrand with a new variable.
*Partial Fractions**: Decomposing rational functions into simpler fractions for easier integration.
*Integration By Parts**: A technique to integrate the product of two functions

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:** Evaluate the definite integral: ∫xcos(x)dx from 0 to π/2
***
**Solution:**

**1. Identify the technique:** This requires integration by parts since you have a product of two functions(x & cosx).

**2. Apply the integration by parts formula:** ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu

*Let u = x (easier to differentiate) and dv = cos(x)dx.*
*Then du = dx and v = sin(x).*

So, ∫x cos(x) dx = x sin(x) - ∫sin(x) dx
                    = x sin(x) + cos(x) + C

**3. Apply limits of integration and evaluate:**

[x sin(x) + cos(x)] from 0 to π/2
= [(π/2)sin(π/2) + cos(π/2)] - [0*sin(0) + cos(0)]
=[(π/2)*1 + 0]-[0+1]
= π/2 - 1
