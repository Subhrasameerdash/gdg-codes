### Summary ###
In this chapter, we studied different types of relations and equivalence relation,

### Definitions ###
1 A relation R in a set A is called empty relation, if no element of A is
2  A relation R in a set A is called universal relation, if each element of A
3 A relation R in a set A is called
(i)
4 A relation R in a set A is said to be an equivalence relation if R is
5 A function f : X → Y is defined to be one-one (or injective), if the images
6 A function f : X → Y is said to be onto (or surjective), if every element
7 A function f : X → Y is said to be one-one and onto (or bijective), if f is
8 Let f : A → B and g : B → C be two functions. Then the composition of
9 A function f : X → Y is defined to be invertible, if there exists a function
of Y, y = 4x + 3,
of function which was being used till the set
of function presently used, was given after set theory was
of function
given by Dirichlet
