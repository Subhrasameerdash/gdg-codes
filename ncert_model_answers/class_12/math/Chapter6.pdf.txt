### Summary ###
® If a quantity y varies with another quantity x, satisfying some rule 
( )

### Definitions ###
1 Let I be an interval contained in the domain of a real valued function f.
2 Let x0 be a point in the domain of definition of a real valued function  f.
for the case of increasing function.
1, it follows that f is strictly increasing on R.
3 Let f be a function defined on an interval I. Then
(a)
 f is said to have a maximum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that

of the function.
Definition 4 Let  f  be a real valued function and let c be an interior point in the domain
states that if  x = c is a point of local maxima of  f,
