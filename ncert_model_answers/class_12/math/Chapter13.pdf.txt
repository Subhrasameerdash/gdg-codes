### Summary ###
The salient features of the chapter are –
® The conditional probability of an event E, given the occurrence of the event F

### Definitions ###
1 If  E and F are two events associated with the same sample space of a
of
can also be used in
2 Two events E and F are said to be independent, if
we need to have P (E) ≠ 0 and  P(F) ≠ 0
3 Let E and F be two events associated with the same random experiment,
and

### Solved Examples ###
If P(A) = 7
13 , P(B) = 9
13  and P(A ∩ B) = 4
13 , evaluate P(A|B).
