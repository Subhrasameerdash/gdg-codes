### Summary ###
Okay, here's a breakdown of the chapter content you provided, focusing on explaining the concepts and how to approach the exercises, rather than just copying the answer key.

**Summary:**

This chapter focuses on integral calculus, specifically techniques of integration. It covers:

1.  **Basic Integration:** Finding antiderivatives of simple functions using standard formulas.
2.  **Integration by Substitution:**  A method to simplify integrals by changing the variable. It involves recognizing a function and its derivative within the integral.
3.  **Integration of Trigonometric Functions:** Using identities to transform trigonometric integrals into solvable forms.
4.  **Integration by Parts:**  A technique used when the integrand is a product of two functions.

**Key Concepts (Definitions Explained):**

*   **Integration:** The reverse process of differentiation. It finds a function whose derivative is the given function. The result is a *family* of functions, differing by a constant (the constant of integration, "C").
*   **Antiderivative:** A function whose derivative equals a given function.
*   **Integration by Substitution:** Simplify complex integrals by substituting 'u' for a function within the integral, along with 'du' for its derivative multiplied by dx. This transforms the integral into a simpler form in terms of 'u'.
*   **Integration by Parts:** Used for integrating products of functions. The formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du, where you carefully choose which part of the integrand to call 'u' and which to call 'dv'.

**Example (Integration by Substitution):**

**Problem:** Evaluate ∫2x(x² + 1)⁵ dx

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify a suitable substitution:** Let u = x² + 1
2.  **Find the derivative of u:** du/dx = 2x  => du = 2x dx
3.  **Substitute:** The integral becomes ∫u⁵ du
4.  **Integrate with respect to u:** ∫u⁵ du = (u⁶)/6 + C
5.  **Substitute back:** Replace u with x² + 1:  ((x² + 1)⁶)/6 + C

### Definitions ###
Okay, here's a breakdown of what the provided NCERT answer key snippets cover, explained simply for educational purposes.

**Overall Topic:** Indefinite Integrals

**Summary:**

This section provides solutions to exercises related to finding indefinite integrals (antiderivatives) of various functions. It covers techniques like:

*   **Direct Integration:** Applying basic integration formulas.
*   **Substitution:**  Simplifying integrals by substituting a part of the function with a new variable.
*   **Integration by Parts:** Integrating the product of two functions.
*   **Partial Fractions:** Breaking down rational functions into simpler fractions for easier integration.
*   **Special Integrals:** Using specific formulas for integrals involving square roots and quadratic expressions.

**Definitions (Key Concepts):**

*   **Indefinite Integral:** The indefinite integral of a function f(x) is a function F(x) whose derivative is f(x).  In simpler terms, it's finding the original function *before* you took the derivative. It always includes a "+ C" (constant of integration) because the derivative of a constant is zero.
*   **Constant of Integration (C):** Since the derivative of a constant is always zero, when finding an indefinite integral, we add "C" to represent any possible constant term that could have been in the original function.

**Solved Example (Substitution Method):**

**Problem:** Find the indefinite integral of  2x / (1 + x^2)  with respect to x.

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify a suitable substitution:** Let u = 1 + x^2
2.  **Find the derivative of u:** du/dx = 2x  =>  du = 2x dx
3.  **Substitute:** The integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du
4.  **Integrate:** ∫ (1/u) du = log|u| + C
5.  **Substitute back:** Replace u with 1 + x^2 => log|1 + x^2| + C

   Since (1+x^2) is always positive, we can drop the absolute value:

   **Answer:** log(1 + x^2) + C

### Solved Examples ###
Okay, I can help you with that. Let's break down some concepts from the provided answers related to indefinite integrals.

**Summary:**

This chapter seems to be about indefinite integrals, focusing on finding antiderivatives of various functions. It covers basic integration formulas, integration by substitution, and likely integration by parts and partial fractions (given the complexity of some answers). The goal is to find a function whose derivative is the given function, plus a constant of integration, C.

**Definitions (Key Concepts):**

*   **Indefinite Integral:** The indefinite integral of a function f(x) is a family of functions whose derivative is f(x). It's represented as ∫f(x) dx = F(x) + C, where F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), and C is the constant of integration.

*   **Antiderivative:** An antiderivative of a function f(x) is a function F(x) such that F'(x) = f(x).

*   **Constant of Integration (C):**  Since the derivative of a constant is always zero, when finding an indefinite integral, we add "C" to represent that any constant could be part of the antiderivative.

*   **Integration by Substitution:** A technique used to simplify integrals by substituting a part of the integrand with a new variable (often 'u') and its differential. This is essentially the chain rule in reverse.

*   **Integration by Parts:** A technique used to integrate the product of two functions. It follows the formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du

**Solved Example (Integration by Substitution):**

**Problem:** Evaluate the indefinite integral: ∫2x * sin(x²) dx

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify a suitable substitution:** Let u = x². Then, du/dx = 2x, which means du = 2x dx. Notice that 2x dx is present in our integral.

2.  **Substitute:** Replace x² with u and 2x dx with du in the integral:
    ∫sin(u) du

3.  **Integrate:** The integral of sin(u) with respect to u is -cos(u).  So, we have:
    -cos(u) + C

4.  **Substitute back:** Replace u with x² to get the final answer in terms of x:
    -cos(x²) + C

Therefore, ∫2x * sin(x²) dx = -cos(x²) + C
