### Summary ###
® A matrix is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions.
® A matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order m × n.
® [aij]m × 1 is a column matrix.
® [aij]1 × n is a row matrix.
® An m × n matrix is a square matrix if m = n.
® A = [aij]m × m is a diagonal matrix if aij = 0, when i ≠ j.
® A = [aij]n × n is a scalar matrix if aij = 0, when i ≠ j, aij = k, (k is some

### Definitions ###
1  A matrix is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The
2 Two matrices A = [aij] and B = [bij] are said to be equal if
(i)
3  If A = [aij] be an m × n matrix, then the matrix obtained by interchanging
4 A square matrix A = [aij] is said to be symmetric if A′ = A, that is,
[aij] = [aji] for all possible values of i and j.
5 A square matrix A = [aij] is said to be skew symmetric matrix if
6 If A is a square matrix of order m, and if there exists another square
of inverse of a matrix, we have
(AB) (AB)–1 = 1
