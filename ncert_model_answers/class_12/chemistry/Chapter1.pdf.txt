**Chapter Summary: Solutions**

This chapter explores the fascinating world of solutions, which are homogeneous mixtures crucial to many aspects of our lives and bodies. We start by defining different types of solutions based on the physical states of the solute and solvent (gas, liquid, solid). Then, we discuss ways to express the concentration of a solution quantitatively using units like mass percentage, volume percentage, parts per million (ppm), mole fraction, molarity, and molality, noting when each is most appropriate and temperature-dependent. We delve into factors affecting solubility, including the "like dissolves like" principle, temperature effects (Le Chatelier's principle), and pressure effects (Henry's Law) for gases. The chapter then examines the vapor pressure of liquid solutions, introducing Raoult's Law to describe ideal solutions and exploring deviations in non-ideal solutions and azeotropes. Finally, we discuss colligative properties (relative lowering of vapor pressure, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure) and their use in determining molar masses, as well as abnormal molar masses due to dissociation or association, introducing Van't Hoff factor.

**Definitions of Key Concepts**

*   **Solution:** A solution is a special type of mixture where everything is evenly distributed at a molecular level. Think of it like perfectly mixed sugar in water – you can't see the individual sugar particles anymore.
*   **Solute:** The substance that gets dissolved in a solution, for example, the sugar.
*   **Solvent:** The substance that does the dissolving, for example, the water.
*   **Concentration:** A measure of how much solute is present in a solution. It can be expressed in several ways.
*   **Molarity (M):** Moles of solute per liter of solution. It tells you how many solute molecules are in a specific volume of the solution.
*   **Molality (m):** Moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. It's useful because it *doesn't* change with temperature (unlike molarity, which depends on volume).
*   **Mole Fraction (x):** The ratio of the number of moles of a component to the total number of moles of all components in the solution. It's a way to express concentration without using mass or volume.
*   **Solubility:** The maximum amount of a solute that can dissolve in a specific amount of solvent at a particular temperature.
*   **Henry's Law:** This law describes the solubility of gases in liquids. It states that the amount of a gas that dissolves in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the liquid.
*   **Raoult's Law:** This law relates the vapor pressure of a solution to the vapor pressure of the pure solvent and the mole fraction of the solvent in the solution. It's useful for understanding how adding a solute affects the vapor pressure of a liquid.
*   **Ideal Solution:** A solution that obeys Raoult's law perfectly. In reality, perfectly ideal solutions are rare.
*   **Colligative Properties:** Properties of solutions that depend only on the *number* of solute particles present, not on the *type* of solute. These include:
    *   **Boiling Point Elevation:** The boiling point of a solution is higher than the boiling point of the pure solvent.
    *   **Freezing Point Depression:** The freezing point of a solution is lower than the freezing point of the pure solvent.
    *   **Osmotic Pressure:** The pressure required to stop the flow of solvent across a semipermeable membrane from a region of high solvent concentration to a region of low solvent concentration.
*   **Van't Hoff Factor (i):** A factor used to correct for the fact that some solutes dissociate (split into ions) or associate (join together) in solution, which affects the colligative properties.

**Solved Example**

**Problem:** A solution is prepared by dissolving 5.65 g of a non-volatile organic compound in 25.0 g of diethyl ether. The boiling point of the pure diethyl ether is 34.51 °C, and the solution boils at 35.19 °C. The Kb value for diethyl ether is 2.02 K kg/mol. Estimate the molar mass of the organic compound.

**Solution:**

1.  **Calculate the elevation in boiling point (ΔTb):**

    ΔTb = Boiling point of solution - Boiling point of pure solvent
    ΔTb = 35.19 °C - 34.51 °C = 0.68 °C  (Since the Celsius and Kelvin scales have the same size divisions, ΔT in °C is the same as ΔT in K).

2.  **Apply the boiling point elevation formula:**

    ΔTb = Kb * m  where m is the molality of the solution.

3.  **Solve for molality (m):**

    m = ΔTb / Kb
    m = 0.68 K / 2.02 K kg/mol = 0.337 mol/kg

4.  **Relate molality to the mass and molar mass of the solute:**

    Molality (m) = (moles of solute) / (mass of solvent in kg)

    moles of solute = mass of solute / molar mass of solute = w2/M2
    m = (w2/M2)/ (w1/1000)
    m= (w2 x 1000) / (M2 x w1)
    Where: w2 = mass of solute (5.65 g), w1 = mass of solvent (25.0 g)

5.  **Solve for the molar mass of the solute (M2):**

    M2 = (w2 x 1000) / (m x w1)
    M2 = (5.65 g x 1000)/(0.337 mol/kg x 25.0 g)
    M2= 670.62 g/mol

**Therefore, the estimated molar mass of the organic compound is approximately 670.62 g/mol.**
