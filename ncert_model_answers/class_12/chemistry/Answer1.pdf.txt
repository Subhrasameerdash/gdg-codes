**Summary of the Chapter (Based on the Exercise Problems):**

This chapter seems to cover a wide range of physical chemistry topics, judging from the exercise problems. These include solutions (concentration calculations like molarity, molality, mole fractions, and vapor pressure), electrochemistry (cell potentials, Gibbs free energy, equilibrium constants, conductivity, and electrolysis), and chemical kinetics (rate laws, reaction orders, rate constants, half-life, activation energy, and the effect of temperature on reaction rates), d and f block elements ( Lanthanoids and transition elements). Coordination compounds. The problems require applying various formulas and concepts to solve numerical questions.

**Definitions of Key Concepts (Based on Exercise Problems):**

*   **Molarity (M):** It's a way to measure the concentration of a solution. Specifically, it's the number of moles of solute dissolved in one liter of solution. Example: If you dissolve 1 mole of sugar in enough water to make 1 liter of solution, the molarity is 1 M.

*   **Molality (m):** Another way to express concentration. It's the number of moles of solute dissolved in one *kilogram* of *solvent*. The difference between molality and molarity is that molality uses the mass of the solvent, while molarity uses the volume of the *solution*.

*   **Mole Fraction (x):** It's the ratio of the number of moles of a particular component in a mixture to the total number of moles of all components in the mixture. It's a way to express the relative amount of each substance in a mixture.

*   **Electrode Potential (E):** A measure of the tendency of a chemical species to acquire or lose electrons when it is immersed in a solution. It's measured in volts and indicates the potential difference between an electrode and its solution.

*   **Cell Potential (E°):** The difference between the reduction potentials of the two half-cells in an electrochemical cell under standard conditions (298K, 1 atm pressure, 1M concentration). It indicates the spontaneity of the redox reaction.

*   **Conductivity:** The ability of a substance to conduct electricity. In solutions, it depends on the concentration and mobility of ions.

*   **Rate Law:** An equation that expresses the rate of a chemical reaction in terms of the concentrations of the reactants.

*   **Order of Reaction:** The power to which the concentration of a reactant is raised in the rate law. It indicates how the rate of the reaction is affected by the concentration of that reactant.

*   **Rate Constant (k):** The proportionality constant in the rate law. It's a measure of how fast a reaction proceeds at a given temperature.

*   **Activation Energy (Ea):** The minimum amount of energy required for a reaction to occur. It's the energy barrier that must be overcome for reactants to transform into products.

**Solved Example (Chemical Kinetics):**

**Problem:** The decomposition of a certain compound A follows first-order kinetics. At 500K, the half-life of A is 69.3 seconds. Calculate the time required for 75% of A to decompose at 500K.

**Solution:**

1.  **Understanding First-Order Kinetics:** For a first-order reaction, the rate constant (k) is related to the half-life (t1/2) by the equation:  k = 0.693 / t1/2

2.  **Calculate the Rate Constant (k):**
    k = 0.693 / 69.3 s = 0.01 s-1

3.  **Integrated Rate Law:** For a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is:
    ln( \[A]_t / \[A]_0 ) = -kt
    Where:
    \[A]_t is the concentration of A at time t
    \[A]_0 is the initial concentration of A

4.  **75% Decomposition:** If 75% of A has decomposed, then 25% of A remains. So, \[A]_t = 0.25\[A]_0

5.  **Solve for Time (t):**
    ln( 0.25\[A]_0 / \[A]_0 ) = -0.01 s-1 * t
    ln(0.25) = -0.01 s-1 * t
    -1.386 = -0.01 s-1 * t
    t = -1.386/-0.01 s-1 = 138.6 seconds

**Answer:** It takes 138.6 seconds for 75% of compound A to decompose at 500K.

**Solved Example (Solutions - Colligative Properties):**

**Problem:** A solution is prepared by dissolving 5.0 g of a non-volatile solute in 100 g of water. The vapor pressure of pure water at 298 K is 23.8 mm Hg, and the vapor pressure of the solution is 23.4 mm Hg. Calculate the molar mass of the solute.

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify the Colligative Property:** This problem involves vapor pressure lowering.

2.  **Apply Raoult's Law:** Raoult's Law states that the vapor pressure of a solution is directly proportional to the mole fraction of the solvent.
    *   P<sub>solution</sub> = X<sub>solvent</sub> * P<sup>0</sup><sub>solvent</sub>
    *   Where:
        *   P<sub>solution</sub> = Vapor pressure of the solution (23.4 mm Hg)
        *   X<sub>solvent</sub> = Mole fraction of the solvent (water)
        *   P<sup>0</sup><sub>solvent</sub> = Vapor pressure of the pure solvent (23.8 mm Hg)

3.  **Calculate the Mole Fraction of the Solvent (Water):**
    *   X<sub>solvent</sub> = P<sub>solution</sub> / P<sup>0</sup><sub>solvent</sub> = 23.4 mm Hg / 23.8 mm Hg = 0.983

4.  **Calculate the Mole Fraction of the Solute:**
    *   X<sub>solute</sub> = 1 - X<sub>solvent</sub> = 1 - 0.983 = 0.017

5.  **Calculate the Moles of Water:**
    *   Moles of water = mass of water / molar mass of water = 100 g / 18 g/mol = 5.56 mol

6.  **Relate Mole Fraction to Moles of Solute:**
    *   X<sub>solute</sub> = moles of solute / (moles of solute + moles of solvent)
    *   0.  017 = moles of solute / (moles of solute + 5.56 mol)

7.  **Solve for Moles of Solute:**
    *   0.  017 * (moles of solute + 5.56 mol) = moles of solute
    *   0.  017 * moles of solute + 0.0945 = moles of solute
    *   0.  0945 = moles of solute - 0.017 * moles of solute
    *   0.  0945 = 0.983 * moles of solute
    *   Moles of solute = 0.0945 / 0.983 = 0.096 mol

8.  **Calculate the Molar Mass of the Solute:**
    *   Molar mass of solute = mass of solute / moles of solute = 5.0 g / 0.096 mol = 52.1 g/mol

**Answer:** The molar mass of the solute is approximately 52.1 g/mol.
