Okay, here's the educational content based on the NCERT chapter excerpt you provided, focusing on definitions, a summary and example:

**Chapter Definitions: Semiconductor Electronics**

*   **Vacuum Tubes (Valves):** Early electronic devices that control electron flow in a vacuum using electrodes. They are bulky, inefficient, and require high voltages.

*   **Semiconductors:** Materials with conductivity between metals and insulators. Their conductivity can be controlled by external factors like light, heat, or voltage.

*   **Doping:** The process of adding impurities to a semiconductor to alter its electrical conductivity.

*   **Intrinsic Semiconductor:** A pure semiconductor material with an equal number of electrons and holes.

*   **Extrinsic Semiconductor:** A semiconductor material that has been doped to increase its conductivity.

*   **n-type Semiconductor:** A semiconductor doped with pentavalent impurities, resulting in more free electrons than holes.

*   **p-type Semiconductor:** A semiconductor doped with trivalent impurities, resulting in more holes than free electrons.

*   **p-n Junction:** A junction formed by joining p-type and n-type semiconductor materials, creating a diode.

*   **Depletion Region:** A region within a p-n junction where charge carriers are depleted, creating an electric field.

*   **Forward Bias:** Applying a voltage to a p-n junction such that the p-side is positive and the n-side is negative, allowing current to flow.

*   **Reverse Bias:** Applying a voltage to a p-n junction such that the n-side is positive and the p-side is negative, blocking current flow.

*   **Rectifier:** A circuit that converts AC voltage into DC voltage using diodes.

**Chapter Summary:**

This chapter introduces semiconductor electronics, contrasting it with older vacuum tube technology. It explains how semiconductors' conductivity lies between metals and insulators and how it can be controlled. The text details intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors, focusing on n-type and p-type materials created through doping. It then introduces the p-n junction diode, its formation, behavior under forward and reverse bias, and its application as a rectifier.

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:** A silicon semiconductor is doped with 1 part per million (ppm) of a pentavalent impurity. If the silicon crystal has 5 x 10^28 atoms/m^3, and the intrinsic carrier concentration is 1.5 x 10^16 /m^3, calculate the electron and hole concentrations.

**Solution:**

1.  **Donor Concentration (ND):**
    *   1 ppm means 1 impurity atom per 10^6 silicon atoms.
    *   ND = (1/10^6) * (5 x 10^28 atoms/m^3) = 5 x 10^22 /m^3

2.  **Electron Concentration (ne):**
    *   Since it's an n-type semiconductor, the electron concentration is approximately equal to the donor concentration.
    *   ne ≈ ND = 5 x 10^22 /m^3

3.  **Hole Concentration (nh):**
    *   Use the mass action law: ne * nh = ni^2
    *   nh = (ni^2) / ne = (1.5 x 10^16 /m^3)^2 / (5 x 10^22 /m^3)
    *   nh = (2.25 x 10^32 /m^6) / (5 x 10^22 /m^3) = 4.5 x 10^9 /m^3

**Answer:** The electron concentration is approximately 5 x 10^22 /m^3, and the hole concentration is 4.5 x 10^9 /m^3.
