### Summary ###
1.

### Definitions ###
[Eq. (3.2)] I Dt, where I is the magnitude of the current. Hence,
I is related to the magnitude |j| of the current density by

### Solved Examples ###
ne
(a) Estimate the average drift speed of conduction
Example 3.2
(a) In Example 3.1, the electron drift speed is estimated to be only a
Unlike metals, the resistivities of semiconductors decrease with
An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating
Example 3.4 The resistance of the platinum wire of a platinum
This applies equally well if instead of a junction of
A battery of 10 V and negligible internal resistance is
Similation for application of Kirchhoff’s rules:
Solution  The network is not reducible to a simple series and parallel
In a general network, there will be no such simplification due to symmetry,
Example 3.6 Determine the current in each branch of the network
Solution  Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown current
immediately gives us the relations I1 = I3 and I2 = I4. Next, we apply
The four arms of a Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 3.19) have
A galvanometer of 15W resistance is connected across BD. Calculate
of (a) is when r increases with I (even if temperature is
