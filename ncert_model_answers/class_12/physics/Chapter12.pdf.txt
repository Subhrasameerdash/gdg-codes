**Summary:**

This chapter explores the structure of the atom, moving from early models to a more accurate quantum mechanical understanding. It starts with the limitations of classical physics in describing atomic behavior and introduces Bohr's model, which successfully explained the hydrogen spectrum by quantizing electron orbits and energy levels. The chapter also connects Bohr's quantization condition to de Broglie's hypothesis of matter waves, explaining why only certain orbits are allowed.

**Definitions:**

*   **Thomson's Plum Pudding Model:** An early atomic model where positive charge is uniformly spread throughout the atom, with electrons embedded like plums in a pudding.

*   **Rutherford's Nuclear Model:** An atomic model where almost all the mass and positive charge are concentrated in a tiny nucleus, with electrons orbiting around it.

*   **Alpha-particle Scattering:** An experiment where alpha particles are fired at a thin metal foil to probe the structure of atoms. The scattering patterns revealed the existence of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus.

*   **Emission Spectrum:** The spectrum of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation emitted by an atom when its electrons transition from higher to lower energy levels. It appears as a series of bright lines.

*   **Absorption Spectrum:** The spectrum of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation absorbed by an atom when its electrons transition from lower to higher energy levels. It appears as a series of dark lines against a continuous spectrum.

*   **Bohr's Postulates:**
    1.  Electrons revolve in specific orbits without radiating energy (stationary states).
    2.  The angular momentum of an electron in these orbits is quantized (L = nh/2π).
    3.  Electrons can transition between orbits by absorbing or emitting photons with energy equal to the energy difference between the orbits (E = hf).

*   **Energy Levels:** Discrete, quantized energy values that electrons in an atom can possess.

*   **Ground State:** The lowest energy state of an atom.

*   **Excited State:** Any energy state of an atom higher than the ground state.

*   **Ionization Energy:** The minimum energy required to remove an electron from an atom in its ground state.

*   **de Broglie's Hypothesis:** The concept that matter (like electrons) exhibits wave-like properties, with a wavelength inversely proportional to its momentum (λ = h/p).

*   **Hydrogenic Atoms:** Atoms with only one electron, such as hydrogen, singly ionized helium, or doubly ionized lithium.

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:** An electron in a hydrogen atom transitions from the n=3 energy level to the n=2 energy level. Calculate the wavelength of the emitted photon.

**Solution:**

1.  **Find the energies of the initial and final states:**
    *   E3 = -13.6 eV / (3^2) = -1.51 eV
    *   E2 = -13.6 eV / (2^2) = -3.40 eV

2.  **Calculate the energy difference (energy of the photon):**
    *   ΔE = E3 - E2 = -1.51 eV - (-3.40 eV) = 1.89 eV

3.  **Convert the energy difference to Joules:**
    *   ΔE (in Joules) = 1.89 eV * (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.028 x 10^-19 J

4.  **Use the equation E = hc/λ to find the wavelength:**
    *   λ = hc/E = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s * 3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.028 x 10^-19 J)
    *   λ = 6.57 x 10^-7 m = 657 nm

**Answer:** The wavelength of the emitted photon is 657 nm (red light).
