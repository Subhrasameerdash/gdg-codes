### Definitions ###
Okay, here's educational content based on the provided NCERT chapter excerpt, focusing on electromagnetic induction:

**Summary:**

This chapter introduces electromagnetic induction, the phenomenon where a changing magnetic field produces an electric current. It covers Faraday's and Henry's experiments, magnetic flux, Faraday's law (quantifying the induced emf), Lenz's law (determining the direction of induced current), motional emf (emf generated by moving conductors in a magnetic field), inductance (mutual and self), and the AC generator (application of electromagnetic induction).

**Definitions:**

*   **Electromagnetic Induction:** The process where a changing magnetic field creates an electromotive force (EMF), which can drive an electric current in a closed circuit. Essentially, magnetism is used to generate electricity.
*   **Magnetic Flux (ΦB):**  A measure of the amount of magnetic field "lines" passing through a given area.  It's calculated as B⋅A (B is magnetic field strength, A is the area vector). A changing magnetic flux is what induces an EMF.
*   **Faraday's Law:**  States that the magnitude of the induced EMF in a circuit is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit:  ε = -dΦB/dt. The more rapidly the magnetic flux changes, the greater the induced EMF.
*   **Lenz's Law:** Dictates the direction of the induced current. The induced current will flow in a direction that creates a magnetic field opposing the *change* in the original magnetic flux. This "opposing" action is why there's a negative sign in Faraday's Law.
*   **Motional EMF:**  The EMF generated when a conductor moves through a magnetic field. Free charges in conductor feel Lorentz force and that induces electric field in conductor.
*   **Mutual Inductance (M):** A measure of how effectively a change in current in one coil induces an EMF in a neighboring coil. Depends on their geometry and proximity.
*   **Self-Inductance (L):** A measure of how effectively a coil induces an EMF in *itself* due to a change in its own current. Depends on the coil's geometry and the material within it.

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:** A circular coil with 200 turns and a radius of 5cm is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.2 T, with its plane perpendicular to the field. The coil is then rotated so that its plane is now parallel to the field in 0.1 seconds. Calculate: (a) the initial magnetic flux through the coil, (b) the final magnetic flux through the coil, (c) the magnitude of the average induced EMF.

**Solution:**

**(a) Initial Magnetic Flux (ΦB initial):**

*   ΦB = B⋅A = BAcosθ
*   Initially, the coil is perpendicular to the field, so θ = 0°.
*   Area of the coil (A) = πr² = π(0.05 m)² ≈ 0.00785 m²
*   ΦB initial = (0.2 T)(0.00785 m²)cos(0°) = 0.00157 Wb
*   Total initial flux linkage (NΦB initial)= 200 * 0.00157 Wb=0.314 Wb

**(b) Final Magnetic Flux (ΦB final):**

*   Finally, the coil is parallel to the field, so θ = 90°.
*   ΦB final = (0.2 T)(0.00785 m²)cos(90°) = 0 Wb
*   Total final flux linkage (NΦB final)= 200 * 0 Wb = 0 Wb

**(c) Magnitude of Average Induced EMF (ε):**

*   ε = | -N(ΔΦB / Δt) | = |-N(ΦB final - ΦB initial) / Δt|
*   ε = | -200(0 Wb - 0.00157Wb) / 0.1 s|
*   ε = |-200 * (-0.00157Wb) / 0.1s|= |0.314 / 0.1|
*   ε= 3.14 V
*  ε = 3.14 V
