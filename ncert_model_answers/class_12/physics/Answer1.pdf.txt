### Definitions ###
Okay, here's some educational content based on the provided NCERT answer key snippets, focusing on Chapters 1 and 2:

**Chapter 1: Electric Charges and Fields**

**Summary:** This chapter deals with the fundamentals of electric charges, the forces they exert on each other (Coulomb's Law), electric fields created by these charges, and the concept of electric flux.

**Definitions:**

*   **Electric Charge:** A fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. Charges can be positive or negative. The unit of charge is the Coulomb (C).

*   **Coulomb's Law:** Describes the force between two point charges. The force is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The force is repulsive if the charges have the same sign and attractive if they have opposite signs.

*   **Electric Field:** A region around an electric charge where another charge would experience a force. It's a vector quantity, with its direction being the direction of the force on a positive test charge.

*   **Electric Flux:** A measure of the number of electric field lines passing through a given surface. It is proportional to the electric field and the area of the surface.

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:** Two point charges, +4 microcoulombs (+4 x 10^-6 C) and -2 microcoulombs (-2 x 10^-6 C), are separated by a distance of 3 meters in a vacuum. Calculate the magnitude of the electrostatic force between them.

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify the knowns:**
    *   Charge 1 (q1) = +4 x 10^-6 C
    *   Charge 2 (q2) = -2 x 10^-6 C
    *   Distance (r) = 3 m
    *   Coulomb's constant (k) = 9 x 10^9 Nm²/C²

2.  **Apply Coulomb's Law:**
    *   F = k * |q1 * q2| / r²

3.  **Substitute the values:**
    *   F = (9 x 10^9 Nm²/C²) * |(4 x 10^-6 C) * (-2 x 10^-6 C)| / (3 m)²
    *   F = (9 x 10^9) * (8 x 10^-12) / 9 N

4.  **Calculate the force:**
    *   F = 8 x 10^-3 N

5.  **State the answer**
    Since the charges are opposite, the force is attractive, with a magnitude of 8 x 10^-3 N.

**Chapter 2: Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance**

**Summary:** This chapter builds on the previous one, introducing the concepts of electric potential, potential energy, and capacitance.

**Definitions:**

*   **Electric Potential:** The amount of work needed to move a unit positive charge from a reference point (usually infinity) to a specific point in an electric field. It's a scalar quantity, measured in volts (V).

*   **Potential Energy:** The energy a charge possesses due to its position in an electric field.

*   **Capacitance:** A measure of a capacitor's ability to store electric charge. It's defined as the ratio of the charge stored on the capacitor to the potential difference between its plates. The unit of capacitance is the Farad (F).

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:** A parallel plate capacitor has a capacitance of 5 microfarads (5 x 10^-6 F) and is charged to a potential difference of 12 Volts. Calculate the charge stored on the capacitor and the energy stored in the capacitor.

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify the knowns:**
    *   Capacitance (C) = 5 x 10^-6 F
    *   Potential difference (V) = 12 V

2.  **Calculate the charge (Q) using the formula Q = CV:**
    *   Q = (5 x 10^-6 F) * (12 V)
    *   Q = 60 x 10^-6 C
    *   Q = 6.0 x 10^-5 C

3.  **Calculate the energy (U) stored using the formula U = 1/2 CV^2:**
    *   U = (1/2) * (5 x 10^-6 F) * (12 V)^2
    *   U = (1/2) * (5 x 10^-6 F) * (144 V^2)
    *   U = 360 x 10^-6 J
    *   U = 3.6 x 10^-4 J

**Answer:** The charge stored on the capacitor is 6.0 x 10^-5 C, and the energy stored is 3.6 x 10^-4 J.

**Solved Example:**

**Problem:** A parallel-plate capacitor has a capacitance of 5 μF. The distance between the plates is doubled, and a dielectric material with a dielectric constant of 2.5 is inserted between the plates. What is the new capacitance?

**Solution:**

1.  **Initial Capacitance:** We're given the initial capacitance, \(C_1 = 5 \times 10^{-6} \) F.

2.  **Capacitance Formula:** Recall that the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by \(C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}\), where \(\epsilon\) is the permittivity of the material between the plates ( \(\epsilon_0 K\) where K is dielectric constant), *A* is the area of the plates, and *d* is the distance between them.

3.  **Changes:** The distance *d* is doubled (new distance is 2*d*), and a dielectric with *K*=2.5 is inserted.

4.  **New Capacitance (C2):** The new capacitance \(C_2\) is given by:

    \(C_2 = \frac{K \epsilon_0 A}{2d} = \frac{2.5 \epsilon_0 A}{2d} \)

5.  **Relate C2 to C1:** Notice that \(\frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}\) is just the original capacitance \(C_1\). Therefore, we can write:

    \(C_2 = \frac{2.5}{2} C_1 = 1.25 C_1\)

6.  **Calculate C2:** Substitute the value of \(C_1\):

    \(C_2 = 1.25 \times (5 \times 10^{-6} ) = 6.25 \times 10^{-6}\) F

**Answer:** The new capacitance is \(6.25 \times 10^{-6}\) F or 6.25 μF.
