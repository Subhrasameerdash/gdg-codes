above the recessive trait
is different types of red blood cells that determine ABO
of ABO blood grouping also provides
of multiple alleles? Here you  can see that there are
Morgan hybridised yellow-bodied,
he found that the genes white and yellow were very tightly linked
for this. In a polygenic trait the phenotype reflects the
of this is the disease phenylketonuria, which occurs in
of
of male heterogamety. In some other organisms, e.g.,
