Okay, I will evaluate the student's answer based on the accuracy, clarity, and structure criteria for a CBSE class 11-12 level assignment.

**Overall Comments**

The student answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts of limits, continuity, and differentiability.  The student provides clear explanations, relevant examples, and correct proofs using the first principle of derivatives. The answers are well-structured and easy to follow.

**Question 1 Evaluation**

*   **Accuracy:** 100%. The explanation, example, and scenario provided are accurate and comprehensively address the question. The student clearly shows why a limit can exist at a point where the function is either undefined or discontinuous.
*   **Clarity:** 100%. The explanation is very clear, using simple language and well-chosen examples. The use of "lim (xâ†’2)" notation is correct and helpful. The summary at the end reinforces the key takeaways.
*   **Structure:** 100%. The answer is logically structured. It begins with a general statement, provides a concrete example, explains the scenario with discontinuity, and concludes with a summary.

**Question 1 Score: 100/100 Grade: A**

**Question 2 Evaluation**

*   **Accuracy:** 100%. The proof of the product rule is mathematically sound and accurate. All steps are correctly executed, and the use of the limit definition is appropriate. The proof demonstrates a strong grasp of calculus principles.
*   **Clarity:** 95%. The explanation is generally clear, but could benefit from a bit more emphasis on *why* f(x + h) approaches f(x) (due to the *definition* of continuity). While differentiability implies continuity is mentioned, explicitly tying the two in the limit step would enhance clarity.
*   **Structure:** 100%. The answer is very well-structured. It starts with the definition of the derivative, then the step-by-step manipulation of the equation, clearly stating the limit laws and justifications used. It concludes with a clear statement of the proven rule.

**Question 2 Score: 98/100 Grade: A** (Slight deduction for the subtle omission of explicitly mentioning the *definition* of continuity is used to show lim h->0 f(x+h) = f(x))

**Question 3 Evaluation**

*   **Accuracy:** 100%. The explanation of why f'(0) does not exist for f(x) = |x| is accurate and complete. The computation of both the left-hand and right-hand limits is correctly executed, and the conclusion is valid. The relationship between continuity and differentiability is also accurately explained.
*   **Clarity:** 100%. The explanation is very clear and easy to understand. The separation of the left-hand and right-hand limits makes the argument convincing. The implication for continuity and differentiability is well-stated and clearly connects the theoretical concepts to the specific example.
*   **Structure:** 100%. The answer is logically organized. It starts with the definition of the derivative, then calculates the left and right limits, then clearly explains the implications.

**Question 3 Score: 100/100 Grade: A**

**Overall Score:**

To get an overall score, we average the scores of the three questions. (100 + 98 + 100) / 3 = 99.33

**Overall Score: 99/100 (Rounded Down) Grade: A**

**Summary of Strengths:**

*   Strong understanding of calculus concepts
*   Accurate application of definitions and theorems
*   Clear and concise explanations
*   Well-structured answers
*   Relevant examples

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   Question 2: Briefly expand on the direct *definition* of continuity being used to show lim h->0 f(x+h) = f(x) during the proof of the product rule. The mention of continuity is sufficient but could be strengthened.

The student demonstrates an excellent grasp of the material. The slight deductions are for minor improvements in clarity and completeness. Overall, the answers are outstanding.
