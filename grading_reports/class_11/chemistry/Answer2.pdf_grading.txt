**1. Accuracy (Score: 85/100):**

*   **Question 1:**
    *   Correctly identifies the anti-Markovnikov addition.
    *   Correctly identifies pent-1-ene as compound 'A' and gives the correct IUPAC name.
    *   Draws all five structural isomers correctly and provides the correct IUPAC names.
    *   Correctly identifies structural isomerism as the type of isomerism. The added nuance of chain and position isomerism further strengthens the answer.
*   **Question 2:**
    *   Correctly states the aromaticity criteria and HÃ¼ckel's rule.
    *   Correctly describes benzene and naphthalene and their aromaticity.
    *   Correctly identifies that naphthalene is more reactive than benzene.
    *   Correctly states that substitution occurs at the alpha (1) position in naphthalene.
*   **Question 3:**
    *   The mass of carbon and hydrogen are correctly calculated.
    *   The mass of oxygen is correctly calculated.
    *   The moles of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are correctly calculated.
    *   The simplest whole-number ratio is correctly calculated.
    *   The empirical formula (C8H16O3) is correctly determined.
    *   Correctly identifies the presence of an alcohol or carboxylic acid group based on the reaction with sodium metal.
    *   Correctly identifies the presence of an aldehyde group based on the reaction with Tollen's reagent.
    *   Correctly concludes that the compound contains *both* an alcohol and an aldehyde.
