Feedback generation failed.Okay, I will now provide a detailed evaluation of the student's answers, based on the criteria outlined in the prompt and the NCERT content provided.

**Overall Score: 90/100**

**Grade: A**

**General Feedback:**

The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the fundamental concepts in chemistry covered by the NCERT syllabus for classes 11-12.  The answers are generally accurate, clear, and demonstrate a good level of reasoning. The student can recall definitions, apply formulas correctly, and explain the significance of various chemical principles.  The presentation is well-organized and easy to follow.  Areas for minor improvement include: 1) Providing more precise and concise examples, especially in the shorter questions, and 2)  Showing a better grasp of approximation techniques and, when applied, checking validity of said approximations in more complex mathematical problems (as demonstrated in equilibrium question).
