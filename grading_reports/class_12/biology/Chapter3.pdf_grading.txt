Okay! Here's a breakdown of the student's answer based on your criteria:

**Overall Score:** 88/100

**Grade:** A

**Detailed Feedback:**

**Strengths:**

*   **Accuracy (28/30):** The student demonstrates a very strong understanding of the topics covered in the model answer. The explanations are generally accurate and incorporate key concepts. The student also includes detailed information not present in the model, improving the accuracy. The few areas where the student answer is less accurate is in overstating the harm involved in PGD.
*   **Clarity (30/30):** The student answer is exceptionally clear and well-articulated. The language used is appropriate for the target audience (CBSE Class 11-12 students) and the explanations are easy to follow. Complex concepts are explained in a simple and understandable way.
*   **Structure (30/30):** The answer is very well-structured and logically organized. Each question is addressed with a clear introduction, well-defined arguments, supporting examples, potential counterarguments, and a strong conclusion. The use of headings, bullet points, and numbered lists enhances readability and makes the information easier to digest.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Overstating Harm (0/10):** The student answer is very good, however, it falls down by overstating the harm involved in PGD. Stating that "Discarding embryos deemed 'undesirable' raises concerns about the moral status of embryos." is disingenuous and makes a large assumption about the situation involved. Furthermore, the idea of a "slippery slope" is not explored thoroughly enough.

**Specific Comments and Suggestions:**

*   **Overall:** The student has done an excellent job of answering the questions. The depth of knowledge and the clarity of expression are commendable.
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion in each answer is well-written and summarizes the main points effectively.
*   **Public Health Campaign:** The public health campaign outline is particularly well-developed and demonstrates a strong understanding of the challenges and strategies involved in promoting sexual health among adolescents.
*   **Ethical Dilemma:** In this section the question of 'Slippery Slope' needs to be addressed with the counter argument, that it is a hypothetical argument, and difficult to prove. This section also implies harm and suffering when suggesting that unwanted embryos raises concerns about the "Moral Status of Embryos".

In summary, the student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topics, excellent writing skills, and a strong ability to think critically and apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios. With a few minor adjustments to reduce overstatement, this answer is of a very high standard.
