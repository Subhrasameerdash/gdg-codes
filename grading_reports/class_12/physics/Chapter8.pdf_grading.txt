Okay, here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers compared to the provided model answers:

**Overall Assessment**

The student's answers are very good and demonstrate a strong understanding of the concepts. They are well-structured, clear, and mostly accurate. The student effectively applies the concepts to solve the given problems.  There's a good balance between explanation and mathematical derivation.

**Question 1: Maxwell's Bridge**

*   **Accuracy:** 95%.  The student accurately explains the inconsistency in Ampere's Law and how Maxwell's displacement current resolves it. The explanation is thorough and includes the mathematical definition of displacement current and the modified Ampere-Maxwell Law. The diagram is helpful. The explanation of the *significance* of Maxwell's correction is excellent.
*   **Clarity:** 100%. The explanation is exceptionally clear and easy to follow. The use of bullet points and a step-by-step approach enhances understanding.
*   **Structure:** 100%. The answer is well-organized, progressing logically from the problem statement to the solution and explanation.

**Feedback for Question 1:**

*   **Strengths:** Excellent explanation of the core concept, clear articulation of the problem and solution, well-labeled and useful diagram, and a strong understanding of the historical and theoretical significance of Maxwell's contribution.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** Very minor. None, really. The answer is exceptionally well done.

**Question 2: Spectrum Sleuth**

*   **Accuracy:** 90%. The student proposes a reasonable experimental design using interference and resonance to determine the wavelength and frequency of the new radiation. The principles behind each method are accurately described. The classification process is also well explained. The recognition that the detector is the biggest hurdle is spot-on.
*   **Clarity:** 95%. The explanation is generally clear. The use of bullet points and a step-by-step approach makes the experiment easy to understand.
*   **Structure:** 95%. The answer is well-organized, describing the experiment design, procedure, calculations, and classification process in a logical manner.

**Feedback for Question 2:**

*   **Strengths:** Creative experimental design, clear explanation of principles, good organization, and recognition of practical challenges (detector sensitivity).
*   **Areas for Improvement:** While the experiment design is sound, a slightly more detailed description of the *type* of detector for the resonance part would be beneficial. Are we measuring current, voltage or power?  While not strictly *wrong*, it's a little vague.

**Question 3: Capacitor Conundrum**

*   **Accuracy:** 95%. The student correctly derives the expression for the displacement current and explains its contribution to the magnetic field. The derivation is accurate, and the explanation is clear and concise.
*   **Clarity:** 100%. The explanation is very clear and easy to follow. The step-by-step derivation is well presented.
*   **Structure:** 100%. The answer is logically structured, starting with the definition of displacement current and progressing through the derivation and explanation of its consequences.

**Feedback for Question 3:**

*   **Strengths:** Accurate derivation, clear explanation, and logical structure. Good explanation of Ampere-Maxwell's Law.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** Minor. None, really. A perfect score.

**Overall Score and Grade:**

*   **Numerical Score:** 96/100
*   **Grade Letter:** A

**General Feedback:**
