Okay, let's evaluate the student's answer.

**Overall Assessment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts of contrapositive proofs, counterexamples, direct proofs, and proof by contradiction. The explanations are generally clear, and the student provides relevant examples. The answers are well-structured and follow a logical flow.  The framing as "sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student" is a little unnecessary and repetitive, but doesn't detract significantly from the quality of the response.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

**Question 1: Contrapositive Proof (Invertible Matrices)**

*   **Accuracy:** The explanation of why the contrapositive works (logical equivalence) is accurate. The connection between singular matrices, determinants, and invertibility is also correctly explained. The example 2x2 matrix provides a good illustration.
*   **Clarity:** The explanation is very clear and easy to follow, even for someone not intimately familiar with linear algebra. The breakdown of P and Q and "not Q, then not P" is well done.
*   **Structure:** The answer is well-structured. It starts with the definition of the contrapositive, explains the logic, provides the contrapositive statement, gives an explanation of why it works, and then offers a concrete example.
*   **Strengths:** Excellent explanation of logical equivalence and clear link between invertibility and determinants. The example provides concrete understanding.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** While good, the example could be slightly more rigorous. For example, it mentions that *if* an inverse existed, the formula would involve division by zero.  It could more explicitly state that since the determinant is zero, the formula *is* undefined, hence no inverse *can* exist.

**Question 2: Counterexample**

*   **Accuracy:** The answer is perfectly accurate. The choice of x = 0.5 as a counterexample is correct, and the explanation of why it disproves the statement is also correct.
*   **Clarity:**  The explanation is clear and straightforward.  The step-by-step calculation is helpful.
*   **Structure:** The answer is well-structured, starting with a definition of a counterexample, then presenting the chosen example, and finally explaining why it works.
*   **Strengths:** Clear explanation of the concept of a counterexample and effective choice of a counterexample that is easy to understand.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** None significant.

**Question 3: Direct Proof vs. Proof by Contradiction**

*   **Accuracy:** The descriptions of direct proof and proof by contradiction are accurate. The example statement "If *x* is an even integer, then *x*<sup>2</sup> is an even integer" is a good choice.  The direct proof is correct. The proof by contradiction is also logically correct, although arguably slightly less elegant than it could be.
*   **Clarity:** The explanations of the methodologies and purposes of each type of proof are well-written and easy to understand.
*   **Structure:** The answer is well-organized, with clear headings for each proof type and a logical flow of ideas.
*   **Strengths:** Good explanation of the differences between the two proof methods. Effective and relevant example statement.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** The proof by contradiction could be streamlined.  Instead of stating "From the result we can see that x^2 is even", it would be stronger to directly state:  "But x = 2k, therefore x^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2), which is even. This contradicts our assumption that x^2 is odd."

**Overall Score and Grade:**

*   **Score:** 92/100
*   **Grade:** A

**Justification:**

The student demonstrates a solid grasp of the concepts and provides clear, well-structured answers. The explanations are accurate, and the examples are relevant. There are only minor areas for improvement in terms of rigor and elegance in some of the examples. The slightly repetitive framing of the answers as "sample answers" is the only significant stylistic flaw. The excellent understanding and explanation of core mathematical concepts warrant a high score and an A grade.
