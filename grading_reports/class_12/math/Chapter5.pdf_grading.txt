Okay, I will evaluate the student answer based on your criteria, focusing on accuracy, clarity, and structure, and provide a score, grade, and detailed feedback.

**Evaluation of Student Answer**

Let's break down the evaluation of each of the student's answers:

**Question 1 Evaluation:**

*   **Accuracy:** The student's answer is completely accurate. It correctly applies the definition of continuity involving the limit, left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and the function's value at the point. The final relationship *a = b + 2* is also correct.

*   **Clarity:** The explanation is very clear and easy to follow. The student breaks down the problem into logical steps, explaining the reasoning behind each step. The use of bullet points to list the three conditions of continuity enhances clarity. The left-hand limit (LHL) and right-hand limit (RHL) are clearly defined and calculated.

*   **Structure:** The answer is well-structured. It starts with the definition of continuity, applies it to the specific function, calculates the necessary limits, and arrives at a clear conclusion. The structure follows a logical flow that makes the answer easy to understand.

*   **Score:** 100/100

*   **Grade:** A

*   **Feedback:** The answer is excellent. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of continuity and the ability to apply it to a piecewise function. There is really nothing to improve here.

**Question 2 Evaluation:**

*   **Accuracy:** The student's answer is completely accurate. It correctly identifies the component functions and applies the theorem about the continuity of composite functions.

*   **Clarity:** The explanation is very clear and easy to follow. The student breaks down the problem into logical steps, explaining the reasoning behind each step. The use of bullet points enhances clarity.

*   **Structure:** The answer is well-structured. It starts with the identification of component functions, applies the theorem and arrives at a clear conclusion. The structure follows a logical flow that makes the answer easy to understand.

*   **Score:** 100/100

*   **Grade:** A

*   **Feedback:** The answer is excellent. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of continuity and the ability to apply it to a composite function. There is really nothing to improve here.

**Question 3 Evaluation:**

*   **Accuracy:** The student's answer is completely accurate. It correctly calculates the velocity and acceleration by differentiating the displacement function.

*   **Clarity:** The explanation is very clear and easy to follow. The student breaks down the problem into logical steps, explaining the reasoning behind each step.

*   **Structure:** The answer is well-structured. It starts with the identification of the displacement function and applies the differentiation to get velocity and acceleration with clear conclusions. The structure follows a logical flow that makes the answer easy to understand.

*   **Score:** 100/100

*   **Grade:** A

*   **Feedback:** The answer is excellent. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of differentiability and the ability to apply it to velocity and acceleration function. There is really nothing to improve here.

**Overall Evaluation:**

*   **Overall Score:** 100/100
*   **Overall Grade:** A

**General Feedback:**

The student consistently demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts, excellent problem-solving skills, and the ability to communicate mathematical ideas clearly and effectively. The explanations are thorough and well-organized.  The student's answers would serve as excellent examples for other students. Keep up the excellent work!
