        "student_answer": "1.  A student needs an average of at least 60 marks on three tests to achieve a passing grade. They scored 52 and 68 on the first two tests. What range of scores on the third test will guarantee a passing grade? Express your answer as an inequality and represent the solution set on a number line.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content on linear inequalities:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo determine the range of scores the student needs on the third test to achieve a passing grade (average of at least 60), we can set up an inequality. Let 'x' represent the score on the third test.\n\n**1. Setting up the Inequality:**\n\nThe average of the three test scores is calculated as: (Score on Test 1 + Score on Test 2 + Score on Test 3) / 3.  We want this average to be greater than or equal to 60.  Therefore, the inequality is:\n\n(52 + 68 + x) / 3 \u2265 60\n\n**2. Solving the Inequality:**\n\n*   First, simplify the numerator:\n    (120 + x) / 3 \u2265 60\n*   Multiply both sides of the inequality by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n    120 + x \u2265 180\n*   Subtract 120 from both sides to isolate 'x':\n    x \u2265 60\n\n**3. Interpretation and Solution:**\n\nThe solution x \u2265 60 means that the student needs to score at least 60 marks on the third test to achieve a passing grade of 60 or higher.\n\n**4. Representing the Solution Set on a Number Line:**\n\nTo represent this solution on a number line:\n\n*   Draw a number line.\n*   Locate the point 60 on the number line.\n*   Since x is greater than *or equal to* 60, we use a closed circle (or a filled-in dot) at the point 60 to indicate that 60 is included in the solution.\n*   Draw an arrow extending to the right from the closed circle, indicating that all values greater than 60 are also part of the solution.\n\n**Number Line Representation:**\n\n```\n<-------------------------------------------------->\n... 55   56   57   58   59  [60]-->>> 61   62   63 ...\n\n[ represents a closed circle\n--->>> represents the arrow extending to the right\n```\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe student must score 60 or more on the third test to ensure a passing grade.  The inequality representing this is x \u2265 60, and the number line visually represents all possible scores that satisfy this condition.\n\n2.  A company produces two types of widgets, A and B. The cost of producing each widget A is \u20b915 and each widget B is \u20b920. The company has a total budget of \u20b912,000. If they must produce at least 200 widgets in total, and the number of widget A produced is at least twice the number of widget B produced, formulate the constraints as a system of linear inequalities. Do not solve.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content and incorporating clear explanations:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo formulate the constraints for the company's widget production problem as a system of linear inequalities, we need to define our variables first.\n\nLet:\n\n*   *x* represent the number of widget A produced.\n*   *y* represent the number of widget B produced.\n\nNow, let's translate each condition in the problem into an inequality:\n\n1.  **Budget Constraint:** The cost of producing *x* widgets of type A is 15*x*, and the cost of producing *y* widgets of type B is 20*y*. The total cost cannot exceed the budget of \u20b912,000.  Therefore, the inequality is:\n\n    15*x* + 20*y* \u2264 12000\n\n2.  **Minimum Production Constraint:** The company must produce at least 200 widgets in total.  This means the sum of widget A and widget B must be greater than or equal to 200. Therefore, the inequality is:\n\n    *x* + *y* \u2265 200\n\n3.  **Production Ratio Constraint:** The number of widget A produced (*x*) must be at least twice the number of widget B produced (*y*). This translates to:\n\n    *x* \u2265 2*y*\n\n4. **Non-Negativity Constraints:**  Since we cannot produce a negative number of widgets, we must also include the following constraints:\n    * x \u2265 0\n    * y \u2265 0\n\nTherefore, the system of linear inequalities representing the constraints is:\n\n*   15*x* + 20*y* \u2264 12000\n*   *x* + *y* \u2265 200\n*   *x* \u2265 2*y*\n*   *x* \u2265 0\n*   *y* \u2265 0\n\n**Explanation of each constraint:**\n\n*   **Budget Constraint:**  This inequality ensures that the total production cost stays within the allocated budget of \u20b912,000. The left-hand side represents the total cost of producing *x* widgets A and *y* widgets B.\n*   **Minimum Production Constraint:**  This inequality guarantees that the company meets its minimum production target of 200 widgets. The left-hand side represents the total number of widgets produced.\n*   **Production Ratio Constraint:** This inequality reflects the requirement that the production of widget A is at least twice the production of widget B.\n*   **Non-Negativity Constraints:** These constraints are fundamental because we cannot produce a negative quantity of widgets. Production quantities must be zero or positive.\n\n3.  Solve the following compound inequality and graphically represent the solution on a number line: -10 < (2 - 3x)/4 \u2264 2.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, designed for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content.\n\n**Question:** Solve the following compound inequality and graphically represent the solution on a number line: -10 < (2 - 3x)/4 \u2264 2.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo solve the compound inequality  -10 < (2 - 3x)/4 \u2264 2, we need to isolate 'x' in the middle. We'll do this by performing the same operations on all three parts of the inequality.\n\n**Step 1: Multiply all parts by 4**\n\nMultiplying all parts of the inequality by 4, we get:\n\n-10 * 4 < (2 - 3x)/4 * 4 \u2264 2 * 4\n\n-40 < 2 - 3x \u2264 8\n\n**Step 2: Subtract 2 from all parts**\n\nSubtracting 2 from all parts of the inequality, we have:\n\n-40 - 2 < 2 - 3x - 2 \u2264 8 - 2\n\n-42 < -3x \u2264 6\n\n**Step 3: Divide all parts by -3 (and reverse the inequality signs)**\n\nDividing all parts of the inequality by -3.  Remember that when dividing or multiplying an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality signs:\n\n-42 / -3 > -3x / -3 \u2265 6 / -3\n\n14 > x \u2265 -2\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n-2 \u2264 x < 14\n\n**Step 4: Graphical Representation on a Number Line**\n\nTo represent this solution on a number line:\n\n1.  **Draw a number line.**\n2.  **Locate -2 and 14 on the number line.**\n3.  **Place a closed circle (filled-in circle) at -2** because the inequality includes \"-2\" (x \u2265 -2).  This indicates that -2 is part of the solution.\n4.  **Place an open circle (hollow circle) at 14** because the inequality does *not* include \"14\" (x < 14). This indicates that 14 is *not* part of the solution.\n5.  **Shade (or draw a thick line) the region between -2 and 14** to represent all the values of x that satisfy the inequality.\n\n```\n<-------------------------------------------------------->\n     -3  -2  -1   0   1   2 ... 12  13  14  15\n      *===[---------------------------)\n      ^                               ^\n      |                               |\n   Closed circle                    Open Circle\n   (includes -2)                   (excludes 14)\n```\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe solution to the compound inequality -10 < (2 - 3x)/4 \u2264 2  is -2 \u2264 x < 14. This means x can be any real number greater than or equal to -2, but strictly less than 14.  The number line representation visually shows all the values of x that satisfy this condition.\n",
