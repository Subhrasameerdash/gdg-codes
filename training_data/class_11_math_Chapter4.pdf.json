        "student_answer": "1.  Given the complex number Z = (a + bi), where 'a' and 'b' are real numbers, determine the conditions under which Z * (conjugate of Z) will result in a real number. Explain your reasoning using properties of complex conjugates.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nWe are given a complex number Z = a + bi, where 'a' and 'b' are real numbers. We need to find the conditions under which Z * (conjugate of Z) results in a real number.\n\nFirst, let's define the conjugate of Z.  The conjugate of a complex number a + bi is denoted as Z\u0304 and is equal to a - bi.  This is because the conjugate simply changes the sign of the imaginary part of the complex number.\n\nNow, let's multiply Z by its conjugate, Z\u0304:\n\nZ * Z\u0304 = (a + bi) * (a - bi)\n\nUsing the distributive property (or the \"FOIL\" method), we get:\n\nZ * Z\u0304 = a*a - a*bi + bi*a - bi*bi\nZ * Z\u0304 = a\u00b2 - abi + abi - b\u00b2i\u00b2\n\nNotice that the terms -abi and +abi cancel each other out. Also, we know that i\u00b2 = -1. Therefore:\n\nZ * Z\u0304 = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2(-1)\nZ * Z\u0304 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nSince 'a' and 'b' are real numbers, a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 are also real numbers.  The sum of two real numbers (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) is always a real number.\n\n**Therefore, Z * (conjugate of Z) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 will always result in a real number, regardless of the values of 'a' and 'b'.**\n\n**Explanation using properties of complex conjugates:**\n\nThe key property used here is that the product of a complex number and its conjugate eliminates the imaginary part. This is because the imaginary components of the original number and its conjugate have opposite signs.  When multiplied, these imaginary parts cancel out, leaving only the real part, which in this case is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.  The result, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, is also equal to |Z|\u00b2, the square of the modulus of Z, and the modulus of any complex number is, by definition, a real number.  Consequently, its square is also a real number.\n\n2.  A student attempts to find the multiplicative inverse of a complex number. They correctly state the general method but make an error in algebraic manipulation during the simplification process. Construct a complex number (of your choosing) and demonstrate a *specific* incorrect step a student might take when finding its multiplicative inverse. Then, correctly calculate the multiplicative inverse.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student and based on the provided NCERT chapter content:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet's consider the complex number `z = 2 + 3i`.  A student might incorrectly attempt to find the multiplicative inverse (z<sup>-1</sup>) as follows:\n\n**Incorrect Student Solution:**\n\nThe student correctly recalls that the multiplicative inverse is found using the formula:\n\n`z<sup>-1</sup> = conjugate(z) / |z|<sup>2</sup>`\n\nThe conjugate of `z = 2 + 3i` is `2 - 3i`.  The modulus squared of `z` is `|z|<sup>2</sup> = 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> = 4 + 9 = 13`.  So far, so good.\n\nNow, here's the **incorrect step**:\n\nThe student might write:\n\n`z<sup>-1</sup> = (2 - 3i) / 13 = 2 - (3i/13)`\n\n**Explanation of the Error:**\n\nThe error lies in incorrectly applying the division. The student only divides the imaginary part (`3i`) by 13, forgetting to divide the *real* part (2) as well.  Essentially, they fail to distribute the division over both terms in the numerator.\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\nThe correct method for finding the multiplicative inverse is:\n\n1.  **Find the conjugate:** The conjugate of `z = 2 + 3i` is `conjugate(z) = 2 - 3i`.\n\n2.  **Find the modulus squared:** The modulus squared of `z` is `|z|<sup>2</sup> = (2)<sup>2</sup> + (3)<sup>2</sup> = 4 + 9 = 13`.\n\n3.  **Divide the conjugate by the modulus squared:**\n\n`z<sup>-1</sup> = (2 - 3i) / 13 = 2/13 - (3/13)i`\n\nTherefore, the correct multiplicative inverse of `2 + 3i` is `2/13 - (3/13)i`.\n\n**In summary:** The common error is failing to distribute the denominator correctly when dividing a complex number by a real number. Remember to divide *both* the real and imaginary parts of the complex number by the denominator.\n\n3.  A complex number is defined as the sum of two other complex numbers Z1 and Z2. Z1 and Z2 are defined as being equal to 2 + 4i and 10 - 20i respectively. Represent this complex number in the form of a + bi. Find the conjugate of the complex number and represent both complex numbers in the Argand plane.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter context:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet's denote the complex number formed by the sum of Z1 and Z2 as Z.  We are given:\n\n*   Z1 = 2 + 4i\n*   Z2 = 10 - 20i\n\nTo find Z, we simply add Z1 and Z2:\n\nZ = Z1 + Z2 = (2 + 4i) + (10 - 20i)\n\nTo add complex numbers, we add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together:\n\nZ = (2 + 10) + (4 - 20)i\nZ = 12 - 16i\n\nTherefore, the complex number Z, represented in the form a + bi, is **12 - 16i**.\n\n**Finding the Conjugate of Z:**\n\nThe conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi.  This means we change the sign of the imaginary part.\n\nSo, the conjugate of Z (denoted as Z\u0304) is:\n\nZ\u0304 = 12 + 16i\n\n**Representing the Complex Numbers in the Argand Plane:**\n\nThe Argand plane is a graphical representation of complex numbers, where the x-axis represents the real part and the y-axis represents the imaginary part.  We can plot each of our complex numbers as points on this plane:\n\n*   **Z1 = 2 + 4i:** This is represented by the point (2, 4) on the Argand plane.\n*   **Z2 = 10 - 20i:** This is represented by the point (10, -20) on the Argand plane.\n*   **Z = 12 - 16i:** This is represented by the point (12, -16) on the Argand plane.\n*   **Z\u0304 = 12 + 16i:** This is represented by the point (12, 16) on the Argand plane.\n\n**Explanation of Argand Plane Representation:**\n\nImagine a standard x-y coordinate plane.  For each complex number:\n\n1.  The real part (a) corresponds to the x-coordinate.\n2.  The imaginary part (b) corresponds to the y-coordinate.\n\nTherefore, to plot a complex number a + bi, you simply locate the point (a, b) on the Argand plane. The conjugate will be the reflection across the x axis of the original point.\n",
