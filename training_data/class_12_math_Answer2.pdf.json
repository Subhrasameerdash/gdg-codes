        "student_answer": "1.  **Conceptual Understanding & Application of Substitution:** The rate of change of a function *f(x)* is given by *3x\u221a(x\u00b2 + 4)*. Knowing that *f(0) = 1*, determine the function *f(x)*. Explain the role of the constant of integration in this specific problem.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the given assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student and based on the provided chapter content.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**1. Finding *f(x)***\n\nWe are given that the rate of change of *f(x)* is *3x\u221a(x\u00b2 + 4)*. This means:\n\n*f'(x) = 3x\u221a(x\u00b2 + 4)*\n\nTo find *f(x)*, we need to integrate *f'(x)* with respect to *x*:\n\n*f(x) = \u222b 3x\u221a(x\u00b2 + 4) dx*\n\nWe can solve this integral using **integration by substitution**.\n\n*   **Step 1: Choose a substitution.**  Let *u = x\u00b2 + 4*.\n*   **Step 2: Find the derivative of u.**  *du/dx = 2x*, which implies *du = 2x dx*.  We need to manipulate our integral to have a *2x dx* term. Notice that we have *3x dx*, so we can rewrite it as (3/2) * 2x dx = (3/2) * du.\n*   **Step 3: Substitute.** The integral becomes:\n\n    *f(x) = \u222b 3x\u221a(x\u00b2 + 4) dx = \u222b (3/2) \u221au du = (3/2) \u222b u<sup>1/2</sup> du*\n*   **Step 4: Integrate with respect to u.** Using the power rule for integration (\u222bx<sup>n</sup> dx = x<sup>n+1</sup>/(n+1) + C), we get:\n\n    *(3/2) \u222b u<sup>1/2</sup> du = (3/2) * (u<sup>3/2</sup> / (3/2)) + C = u<sup>3/2</sup> + C*\n*   **Step 5: Substitute back.**  Replace *u* with *x\u00b2 + 4*:\n\n    *f(x) = (x\u00b2 + 4)<sup>3/2</sup> + C*\n\n**2. Determining the Constant of Integration (C)**\n\nWe are given the initial condition *f(0) = 1*.  This allows us to find the value of *C*. Substitute *x = 0* and *f(0) = 1* into the expression for *f(x)*:\n\n*1 = (0\u00b2 + 4)<sup>3/2</sup> + C*\n*1 = (4)<sup>3/2</sup> + C*\n*1 = (\u221a4)<sup>3</sup> + C*\n*1 = (2)<sup>3</sup> + C*\n*1 = 8 + C*\n*C = 1 - 8 = -7*\n\n**3. Final Expression for *f(x)***\n\nSubstituting the value of *C* back into the expression for *f(x)*, we get:\n\n*f(x) = (x\u00b2 + 4)<sup>3/2</sup> - 7*\n\n**4. Explanation of the Role of the Constant of Integration**\n\nThe constant of integration, *C*, is crucial because it represents the *family* of functions that have the derivative *3x\u221a(x\u00b2 + 4)*. Without the initial condition *f(0) = 1*, we would have infinitely many possible functions that satisfy the given rate of change.\n\nIn this specific problem, the initial condition *f(0) = 1* provides a *specific point* on the graph of *f(x)*. This point allows us to single out *one particular function* from the infinite family of antiderivatives. Essentially, *C* shifts the graph of *(x\u00b2 + 4)<sup>3/2</sup>* vertically. The condition *f(0) = 1* tells us exactly how much to shift the graph down (by 7 units) to get the correct function. If we had a different initial condition (e.g., *f(0) = 5*), the value of *C* would change, and we would obtain a different function *f(x)*, although it would still have the same derivative.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n*f(x) = (x\u00b2 + 4)<sup>3/2</sup> - 7*\n\nThe constant of integration, *C = -7*, is essential for determining the *specific* function *f(x)* that satisfies both the given rate of change and the initial condition *f(0) = 1*. It represents the vertical shift required to make the antiderivative pass through the point (0,1).\n\n2.  **Integration by Parts & Problem-Solving:** A student attempts to evaluate \u222bx\u00b2 * e^(x/2)* dx using integration by parts but makes an error in choosing 'u' and 'dv'. Describe a strategy to guide them to choose suitable functions for 'u' and 'dv', and hence solve the integral completely.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, focusing on guiding them through the process of integration by parts and highlighting common errors:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nOkay, let's tackle this integration by parts problem together. It's a common spot to make mistakes, especially when choosing 'u' and 'dv'. The key is to use a helpful guideline.\n\n**The ILATE Rule:**\n\nA useful strategy is the **ILATE** rule. This helps prioritize your choice for 'u' based on the type of function:\n\n*   **I** - Inverse Trigonometric Functions (e.g., arcsin(x), arctan(x))\n*   **L** - Logarithmic Functions (e.g., ln(x), log(x))\n*   **A** - Algebraic Functions (e.g., x\u00b2, x, constants)\n*   **T** - Trigonometric Functions (e.g., sin(x), cos(x))\n*   **E** - Exponential Functions (e.g., e^x, a^x)\n\nThe function that appears *earliest* in this list should generally be chosen as 'u'.\n\n**Why ILATE Works:**\n\nThe goal of integration by parts is to simplify the integral in the \u222bv du term. Choosing 'u' according to ILATE often makes its derivative (du) simpler, and choosing 'dv' to be easily integrable leads to a manageable 'v'.\n\n**Applying ILATE to our Problem: \u222bx\u00b2 * e^(x/2) dx**\n\n1.  **Identify the function types:** We have an algebraic function (x\u00b2) and an exponential function (e^(x/2)).\n2.  **Apply ILATE:**  'A' (Algebraic) comes before 'E' (Exponential) in the ILATE rule.\n3.  **Choose 'u' and 'dv':**\n    *   Therefore, let  `u = x\u00b2`\n    *   And  `dv = e^(x/2) dx`\n\n**Now, let's proceed with integration by parts:**\n\nThe formula for integration by parts is:  \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\n1.  **Find 'du' and 'v':**\n    *   If u = x\u00b2, then  `du = 2x dx`\n    *   If dv = e^(x/2) dx, then  `v = \u222be^(x/2) dx = 2e^(x/2)`  (Remember to integrate dv to find v.  Using a u-substitution of a=x/2 and da=1/2dx will help solve this)\n\n2.  **Apply the Integration by Parts formula:**\n\n    \u222bx\u00b2 * e^(x/2) dx = (x\u00b2)(2e^(x/2)) - \u222b(2e^(x/2))(2x dx)\n\n    \u222bx\u00b2 * e^(x/2) dx = 2x\u00b2e^(x/2) - 4\u222bx * e^(x/2) dx\n\n3.  **Notice that we still have an integral:**  We need to apply integration by parts *again* to solve \u222bx * e^(x/2) dx. Use the ILATE rule again.\n\n    *   Let `u = x` (Algebraic)\n    *   Let `dv = e^(x/2) dx` (Exponential)\n\n4.  **Find 'du' and 'v' (again):**\n\n    *   If u = x, then `du = dx`\n    *   If dv = e^(x/2) dx, then `v = 2e^(x/2)`  (Same integration as before)\n\n5.  **Apply Integration by Parts formula (again):**\n\n    \u222bx * e^(x/2) dx = (x)(2e^(x/2)) - \u222b(2e^(x/2)) dx\n    \u222bx * e^(x/2) dx = 2xe^(x/2) - 2\u222be^(x/2) dx\n    \u222bx * e^(x/2) dx = 2xe^(x/2) - 2(2e^(x/2)) + C\u2081\n    \u222bx * e^(x/2) dx = 2xe^(x/2) - 4e^(x/2) + C\u2081\n\n6.  **Substitute back into our original equation:**\n\n    \u222bx\u00b2 * e^(x/2) dx = 2x\u00b2e^(x/2) - 4 * [2xe^(x/2) - 4e^(x/2) + C\u2081]\n    \u222bx\u00b2 * e^(x/2) dx = 2x\u00b2e^(x/2) - 8xe^(x/2) + 16e^(x/2) + C   (where C = -4C\u2081)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\u222bx\u00b2 * e^(x/2) dx = 2e^(x/2) * (x\u00b2 - 4x + 8) + C\n\n**Common Errors and Tips:**\n\n*   **Incorrectly choosing 'u' and 'dv':**  This is the most common error. Always use ILATE as a guide. If you choose poorly, the integral \u222bv du might be *more* complicated than the original!\n\n*   **Forgetting the \"+ C\":** Don't forget the constant of integration after each indefinite integral!\n\n*   **Not differentiating 'u' or integrating 'dv' correctly:** Double-check your derivatives and integrals.  A small mistake here will throw off the entire solution.\n\n*   **Not reapplying Integration by Parts:**  Sometimes, you need to use integration by parts multiple times, like in this problem. Don't give up after the first attempt!\n\nBy following the ILATE rule, carefully applying the integration by parts formula, and being mindful of common errors, you can successfully solve integrals of this type.  Practice is key!\n\n3.  **Connecting Concepts & Application:** A curve *y = f(x)* passes through the point (1, 2) and satisfies the differential equation *dy/dx = x*cos(x\u00b2)*. Find the equation of the curve. How does the initial condition *f(1) = 2* help in determining a specific solution from the family of solutions obtained by integration?\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student tackling integral calculus, based on the provided content and focusing on a clear, step-by-step explanation:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo find the equation of the curve *y = f(x)*, we need to solve the given differential equation and then use the initial condition to find the particular solution.\n\n**1. Solving the Differential Equation:**\n\nWe are given *dy/dx = x*cos(x\u00b2)*.  To find *y*, we need to integrate both sides with respect to *x*:\n\n\u222b *dy/dx* dx = \u222b *x*cos(x\u00b2)* dx\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n*y* = \u222b *x*cos(x\u00b2)* dx\n\nNow, we use the method of substitution to solve the integral on the right-hand side.\n\n*   **Let** *u = x\u00b2*.  This is a strategic choice because the derivative of *x\u00b2* is related to the *x* term already present in the integrand.\n*   **Then**, *du/dx = 2x*, which means *du = 2x dx*.  We need to adjust our integral to match this.  Notice we have *x dx*, so we can rewrite *du = 2x dx* as *(1/2)du = x dx*.\n\nNow we can substitute into our integral:\n\n*y* = \u222b cos(u) * (1/2) du\n\n*y* = (1/2) \u222b cos(u) du\n\nWe know that the integral of cos(u) is sin(u):\n\n*y* = (1/2) sin(u) + C\n\nNow, substitute back *u = x\u00b2*:\n\n*y* = (1/2) sin(x\u00b2) + C\n\nThis is the general solution to the differential equation. It represents a *family* of curves, all with the same basic shape, but shifted vertically by different amounts due to the constant *C*.\n\n**2. Applying the Initial Condition:**\n\nWe are given that the curve passes through the point (1, 2). This means that when *x = 1*, *y = 2*. We can use this information to find the value of *C*:\n\n2 = (1/2) sin(1\u00b2) + C\n\n2 = (1/2) sin(1) + C\n\nNow, solve for *C*:\n\nC = 2 - (1/2) sin(1)\n\n**3. The Equation of the Curve (Particular Solution):**\n\nSubstitute the value of *C* back into the general solution:\n\n*y* = (1/2) sin(x\u00b2) + 2 - (1/2) sin(1)\n\nTherefore, the equation of the curve is *y = (1/2)sin(x\u00b2) + 2 - (1/2)sin(1)*.\n\n**4. Explanation of the Initial Condition's Role:**\n\nThe initial condition *f(1) = 2* (or the point (1, 2)) is crucial because it allows us to determine a *unique* solution from the *infinite family* of solutions represented by the general solution  *y = (1/2) sin(x\u00b2) + C*. The general solution includes an arbitrary constant, *C*, which means there are infinitely many curves that satisfy the differential equation.  By providing a specific point that the curve must pass through, we fix the value of *C*, thereby selecting one particular curve from that family. Without the initial condition, we would only have the general solution, which is not a specific equation of a single curve. The initial condition acts as a constraint, pinpointing the specific curve that satisfies both the differential equation *and* passes through the given point. This makes the solution a *particular* solution rather than a general one.\n",

It covers basic integration formulas, integration by substitution, and likely integration by parts and partial fractions (given the complexity of some answers). The goal is to find a function whose derivative is the given function, plus a constant of integration, C.\n\n**Definitions (Key Concepts):**\n\n*   **Indefinite Integral:** The indefinite integral of a function f(x) is a family of functions whose derivative is f(x).
