        "student_answer": "1.  Explain how the electronic configurations of transition metals contribute to their ability to form alloys, and describe *two* properties of alloys that are often superior to those of their constituent pure metals. Use specific examples from the d-block to illustrate your answer.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the question about alloy formation by transition metals:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTransition metals readily form alloys due to the similarity in their atomic sizes and chemical properties. The electronic configuration of d-block elements plays a crucial role in this ability. Here's why:\n\n*   **Metallic Bonding and Electronic Structure:** Transition metals possess metallic bonding, characterized by a \"sea\" of delocalized electrons. These delocalized electrons are free to move throughout the metal lattice, contributing to high electrical and thermal conductivity. The presence of partially filled d-orbitals adds to the strength of this metallic bonding, as the d-electrons also participate in the overall electron density.\n\n*   **Similar Atomic Radii:** Because transition metals have relatively similar atomic radii (especially within a given series), one metal atom can be easily substituted for another in the crystal lattice without causing significant distortion. The lanthanoid contraction also contributes to the size similarity among the 4d and 5d series. This substitutional solid solution formation is essential for alloy formation. If the sizes were drastically different, the lattice would be disrupted, hindering alloy formation.\n\n*   **Comparable Electronegativities:** Transition metals generally have comparable electronegativities, meaning they have a similar tendency to attract electrons. This similarity in electronegativity prevents the formation of strong intermetallic compounds that would segregate instead of forming a homogeneous alloy.\n\n**Superior Properties of Alloys Compared to Pure Metals (with d-block examples):**\n\nAlloys are created to enhance specific properties that the individual metals may lack. Here are two examples:\n\n1.  **Increased Strength and Hardness:** Alloys are often significantly stronger and harder than their constituent metals. This is because the different sized atoms disrupt the regular arrangement of atoms in the crystal lattice, making it more difficult for layers of atoms to slide over each other (which is what happens during deformation).\n\n    *   **Example:** Steel is an alloy of iron (Fe) and carbon (C). Pure iron is relatively soft and easily corroded. The addition of carbon, even in small amounts, significantly increases the strength and hardness of the material. Other elements like chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) are often added to create stainless steel, which is even stronger and more corrosion-resistant.\n\n2.  **Enhanced Corrosion Resistance:** Alloys can be designed to resist corrosion much better than pure metals. This is often achieved by including a metal that forms a protective oxide layer on the surface of the alloy, preventing further oxidation (rusting).\n\n    *   **Example:** Stainless steel, as mentioned above, contains chromium (Cr). Chromium reacts with oxygen in the air to form a thin, stable layer of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) on the surface of the steel. This layer is impermeable to oxygen and water, preventing the iron from rusting.\n\n2.  The lanthanoid contraction has significant consequences for the chemistry of elements following the lanthanoids in the periodic table. Discuss *two* such consequences, explaining the underlying reasons for these effects. Provide specific examples of elements affected by the lanthanoid contraction and the resulting observed trends in their properties.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a sample answer suitable for CBSE Class 11-12 students:\n\nThe lanthanoid contraction, the gradual decrease in atomic and ionic radii across the lanthanoid series (Ce to Lu) due to poor shielding by *f* electrons, has significant consequences for the elements that follow the lanthanoids in the periodic table, particularly the transition metals of the 5d series (Hf to Hg). Here are two key consequences:\n\n**1. Similarity in Size of Second and Third Transition Series:**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Without the lanthanoid contraction, the atomic radii of the 5d series elements would be significantly larger than those of the 4d series. This is because as we move down a group, the principal quantum number (n) increases, leading to larger electron shells and thus, larger atomic size. However, the lanthanoid contraction counteracts this expected increase in size. As the 5d elements follow the lanthanoids, their nuclei experience a greater effective nuclear charge due to the poorly shielded electrons. This pulls the electron cloud closer, resulting in unexpectedly small atomic and ionic radii. The 5d series elements end up having atomic radii that are remarkably similar to those of the 4d series elements directly above them.\n\n*   **Example:** Consider Zirconium (Zr) and Hafnium (Hf). Zirconium is a 4d series element, while Hafnium is the 5d series element directly below it. Based on normal periodic trends, Hf would be expected to be significantly larger than Zr. However, due to the lanthanoid contraction, their atomic radii are surprisingly similar (Zr: 160 pm; Hf: 159 pm). This similarity in size leads to similar chemical properties.\n\n**2. Influence on Density:**\n\n*   **Explanation:** Density is defined as mass per unit volume. The lanthanoid contraction results in a smaller atomic volume for the 5d series elements compared to what would be expected based on their increasing atomic mass. Since the mass increases significantly from the 4d to the 5d series, and the volume does *not* increase proportionally (due to the lanthanoid contraction), the density of the 5d series elements becomes much higher than that of the corresponding 4d series elements.\n\n*   **Example:** Again, consider Zr and Hf. While their atomic radii are similar, Hafnium has a significantly greater atomic mass. This, combined with the contraction in volume, leads to a much higher density for Hafnium (Hf: 13.31 g/cm\u00b3) compared to Zirconium (Zr: 6.51 g/cm\u00b3). Similar trends are observed when comparing other 4d and 5d series element pairs, demonstrating the impact of lanthanoid contraction on density.\n\n3.  A first-row transition metal exhibits a magnetic moment of 3.87 BM in its +2 oxidation state. Identify the metal. Explain, with the help of appropriate electronic configurations, *why* transition metals exhibit variable oxidation states, and discuss *one* important application where the variable oxidation states of transition metals are utilized.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**1. Identifying the Transition Metal:**\n\nThe magnetic moment (\u00b5) is given as 3.87 BM. We can use the spin-only formula to determine the number of unpaired electrons (n):\n\n\u00b5 = \u221a(n(n+2)) BM\n\n3.  87 = \u221a(n(n+2))\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n15 = n(n+2)\n\nBy trial and error, we find that n = 3 satisfies this equation (3(3+2) = 15).  Therefore, the M<sup>2+</sup> ion has 3 unpaired electrons.\n\nTo determine the metal, we need to consider the electronic configuration of the M<sup>2+</sup> ion that results in 3 unpaired electrons.  In the first row of transition metals, this corresponds to a d<sup>5</sup> configuration (with pairing) or a d<sup>3</sup> configuration.\n\n*   If M<sup>2+</sup> has a d<sup>7</sup> configuration: Filling the d orbitals according to Hund's rule, we get t2g^5 eg^2 configuration, which has 3 unpaired electrons. This corresponds to Co2+ ([Ar] 3d7). The metal M would be Cobalt (Co).\n\nTherefore, the first-row transition metal is Cobalt (Co).\n\n**2. Explanation of Variable Oxidation States:**\n\nTransition metals exhibit variable oxidation states due to the small energy difference between the (n-1)d and ns orbitals. This means that electrons from both the (n-1)d and ns orbitals can participate in bonding.\n\n*   **Energy Proximity:** The energies of the (n-1)d and ns orbitals are relatively close. This allows for the removal or participation of electrons from either or both of these orbitals in chemical bonding.\n*   **Successive Ionization Enthalpies:** The ionization enthalpies required to remove electrons from the (n-1)d orbitals are not significantly higher than those required to remove electrons from the ns orbital. This makes it energetically feasible for transition metals to lose different numbers of electrons, leading to multiple oxidation states.\n*   **Example:** Consider Iron (Fe). Its electronic configuration is [Ar] 3d<sup>6</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>. It can lose two electrons from the 4s orbital to form Fe<sup>2+</sup>, or it can lose two electrons from the 4s orbital and one electron from the 3d orbital to form Fe<sup>3+</sup>.\n\n**3. Application of Variable Oxidation States:**\n\nOne important application of the variable oxidation states of transition metals is in **catalysis**.\n\n*   **Catalytic Activity:** Transition metals and their compounds are widely used as catalysts in various industrial processes. Their ability to exhibit variable oxidation states allows them to form unstable intermediate compounds with reactants, providing alternative reaction pathways with lower activation energies.\n\n*   **Example: Vanadium(V) oxide (V2O5) in the Contact Process:** In the Contact Process for the manufacture of sulfuric acid (H2SO4), V2O5 is used as a catalyst to oxidize sulfur dioxide (SO2) to sulfur trioxide (SO3). Vanadium cycles between the +4 and +5 oxidation states during the reaction, facilitating the transfer of oxygen to SO2. The ability of vanadium to readily change its oxidation state makes it an effective catalyst.\n    *   V2O5 + SO2 \u2192 V2O4 + SO3\n    *   V2O4 + 1/2 O2 \u2192 V2O5\n",
        "model_answer": "### Summary ###\nSummary\n\n### Definitions ###\nOkay, here's a breakdown of the d- and f-block elements suitable for an NCERT textbook, focusing on definitions, a summary, and a new solved example.\n\n**Summary of d- and f-Block Elements**\n\nThe d- and f-block elements, also known as transition and inner transition metals, respectively, occupy the center and bottom portions of the periodic table. Transition metals (d-block) are characterized by having partially filled d orbitals, leading to variable oxidation states, colored compounds, catalytic activity, and the formation of complexes. The inner transition metals (f-block) are divided into lanthanoids and actinoids, both series featuring the progressive filling of f orbitals. The lanthanoid contraction, a gradual decrease in size across the lanthanoid series, significantly affects the properties of subsequent elements. Actinoids are radioactive and exhibit a wider range of oxidation states than lanthanoids.\n\n**Definitions**\n\n*   **Transition Metals (d-block elements):** These are elements found in groups 3-12 of the periodic table. A key characteristic is that they have an *incomplete* d subshell in at least one of their ions. This partially filled d-orbital is the reason behind their unique properties.\n    *Example:* Iron (Fe) can exist as Fe2+ or Fe3+, both having incomplete d subshells.\n\n*   **Inner Transition Metals (f-block elements):** These elements are found in two rows at the bottom of the periodic table. They are characterized by the filling of their *f* orbitals. They include the Lanthanoids and Actinoids.\n\n*   **Lanthanoid Contraction:** This refers to the gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic radii of the lanthanoid elements (Ce to Lu). It happens because the *f* electrons don't shield the outer electrons very well from the increasing positive charge of the nucleus. This contraction significantly affects the size and properties of elements that come *after* the lanthanoids in the periodic table.\n\n*   **Variable Oxidation States:** Transition metals commonly exhibit multiple oxidation states in their compounds. This is because the energy levels of the *(n-1)d* and *ns* orbitals are quite close, allowing for the loss of different numbers of electrons.\n\n*   **Interstitial Compounds:** These are compounds formed when small atoms (like hydrogen, carbon, or nitrogen) get trapped inside the crystal lattice of a metal. The trapped atoms change the properties of the metal, making it harder and less ductile.\n\n*   **Alloys:** Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals (or a metal and a non-metal) that are combined to create a material with enhanced properties, such as increased strength or corrosion resistance.\n\n**Solved Example Problem**\n\n**Problem:** A transition metal 'M' forms a divalent ion, M2+, with a magnetic moment of approximately 4.90 Bohr Magnetons (BM). Identify the metal 'M' and write its electronic configuration.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Relate Magnetic Moment to Unpaired Electrons:** The spin-only formula for magnetic moment is:  \u00b5 = \u221a(n(n+2)) BM, where *n* is the number of unpaired electrons. We are given \u00b5 \u2248 4.90 BM.\n\n2.  **Solve for n:**\n    *   4.  90 = \u221a(n(n+2))\n    *   Squaring both sides: 24.01 = n(n+2)\n    *   By trial and error, we find that n = 4 satisfies the equation (4(4+2) = 24).\n        Therefore, there are 4 unpaired electrons.\n\n3.  **Determine the Electronic Configuration of M2+:**  Since M2+ has 4 unpaired electrons, it is likely to have a d4 configuration.\n\n4.  **Identify the Metal:** To form an M2+ ion with a d4 configuration, the neutral metal 'M' must have lost two electrons. So the electronic configuration of neutral M is [Ar] 3d64s2, which implies that the metal is Iron (Fe).\n\n5.  **Final Answer:**\n    *   The metal 'M' is Iron (Fe).\n    *   The electronic configuration of Fe2+ is [Ar] 3d6.\n\n### Solved Examples ###\nExample 4.1\nExample 4.1\nSolution\nExample 4.2\nExample 4.2\nSolution\nExample 4.3\nExample 4.3\nSolution\nExample 4.4\nExample 4.4\nSolution\nExample 4.5\nExample 4.5\nHow would you account for the increasing oxidising power in the\nExample 4.6\nExample 4.6\nIntext Questions\nExample 4.7\nExample 4.7\nSolution\nExample 4.8\nExample 4.8\nSolution\nColour\nWhen a particular oxidation state becomes less stable relative to other\nExample 4.9\nExample 4.9\nSolution\nExample 4.10\nExample 4.10\nSolution\nMagnetic Moment (BM)\n\n### Exercises ###\nNo exercises found.\n\n"
