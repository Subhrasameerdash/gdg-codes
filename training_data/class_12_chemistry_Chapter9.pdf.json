Describe a simple chemical test (or a series of tests) that would allow the technician to identify the contents of each bottle. Explain the chemical basis for the observed differences in reactivity between the three amines.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo identify the *n*-butylamine, di-*n*-butylamine, and tri-*n*-butylamine in the unlabeled bottles, we can use the Hinsberg's test. This test leverages the varying reactivity of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines with Hinsberg's reagent (benzene sulfonyl chloride, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>Cl) and their subsequent solubility in aqueous alkali.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Reaction with Hinsberg's Reagent:** In three separate test tubes, add a small amount of each unknown amine to a solution of benzene sulfonyl chloride in aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Shake the mixture well and observe the results.\n\n    *   **Bottle A:** Amine + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>Cl + NaOH  ->  Observe result\n    *   **Bottle B:** Amine + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>Cl + NaOH  ->  Observe result\n    *   **Bottle C:** Amine + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>Cl + NaOH  ->  Observe result\n\n2.  **Observations and Interpretations:**\n\n    *   **Primary Amine (*n*-butylamine):** The primary amine will react with benzene sulfonyl chloride to form an *N*-alkyl benzene sulfonamide. This sulfonamide will have an acidic hydrogen attached to the nitrogen (R-NH-SO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) and hence will be *soluble* in the aqueous NaOH solution initially. Upon acidification with dilute HCl, the sulfonamide will precipitate out of the solution.\n\n        ```\n        C4H9NH2 + C6H5SO2Cl + NaOH  -> C4H9NHSO2C6H5 (soluble in NaOH) + NaCl + H2O\n        C4H9NHSO2C6H5 + HCl -> C4H9NHSO2C6H5 (precipitate) + HCL\n        ```\n        Observation: Clear solution initially, precipitate forms upon acidification.\n    *   **Secondary Amine (di-*n*-butylamine):** The secondary amine will react to form an *N*, *N*-dialkyl benzene sulfonamide. This sulfonamide will *not* have an acidic hydrogen on the nitrogen (R<sub>2</sub>N-SO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) and will therefore be *insoluble* in the aqueous NaOH solution and forms a precipitate. Adding dilute HCl will have no effect - the precipitate remains.\n\n        ```\n        (C4H9)2NH + C6H5SO2Cl + NaOH -> (C4H9)2NSO2C6H5 (insoluble in NaOH) + NaCl + H2O\n        ```\n        Observation: Immediate precipitate forms, remains after acidification.\n    *   **Tertiary Amine (tri-*n*-butylamine):** Tertiary amines do *not* react with Hinsberg's reagent because they lack a replaceable hydrogen atom on the nitrogen. The mixture will appear cloudy or unchanged, and will remain unchanged after acidification.\n\n        ```\n        (C4H9)3N + C6H5SO2Cl + NaOH -> No Reaction\n        ```\n        Observation: No immediate reaction or precipitate; no change upon acidification.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Amine             | Reaction with Hinsberg's Reagent and NaOH | Effect of Acidification (HCl) | Identification      |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|\n| *n*-butylamine    | Forms a clear solution                     | Precipitate forms                | Primary (1\u00b0)          |\n| di-*n*-butylamine | Forms a precipitate                       | Precipitate remains           | Secondary (2\u00b0)        |\n| tri-*n*-butylamine| No reaction                               | No change                      | Tertiary (3\u00b0)         |\n\n**Chemical Basis for Reactivity Differences:**\n\nThe differences in reactivity arise from the degree of substitution on the nitrogen atom:\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** As the number of alkyl groups attached to the nitrogen increases (from primary to secondary to tertiary), the steric hindrance around the nitrogen atom also increases. This makes it more difficult for the bulky benzene sulfonyl chloride to approach and react with the nitrogen in secondary and especially tertiary amines.\n*   **Availability of Hydrogen:** Primary and secondary amines have one or two hydrogen atoms, respectively, bonded to the nitrogen. These hydrogen atoms can be replaced by the sulfonyl group from Hinsberg's reagent. Tertiary amines have no hydrogen atoms bonded to the nitrogen, so they cannot undergo this reaction.\n*   **Solubility Differences:** The key to the test lies in whether the *product* of the reaction with Hinsberg's reagent is soluble in the initial alkaline solution. The N-substituted sulfonamide from the primary amine has an acidic proton that allows it to dissolve as a salt. The N,N-disubstituted sulfonamide from the secondary amine lacks that acidic proton, making it insoluble.\n\n2.  **Diazonium Salt Synthesis & Application:** A student aims to synthesize *p*-bromophenol from benzene. Outline the necessary sequence of reactions, including specific reagents and conditions, highlighting the crucial role of a diazonium salt intermediate. Explain why the direct bromination of phenol is not a suitable method for obtaining *p*-bromophenol in good yield.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the synthesis of *p*-bromophenol from benzene, emphasizing the role of diazonium salts and the limitations of direct bromination:\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**Synthesis of *p*-Bromophenol from Benzene via a Diazonium Salt Intermediate**\n\nThe synthesis of *p*-bromophenol from benzene requires a multi-step process involving a diazonium salt intermediate. This approach allows for the controlled introduction of the bromine atom at the *para* position. Here's the outline:\n\n**Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n\n*   **Reagents and Conditions:** Concentrated HNO3 (nitric acid) and concentrated H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), heat (around 50-55\u00b0C). Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** Benzene reacts with the nitrating mixture to form nitrobenzene.\n    ```\n    C6H6 + HNO3  --(H2SO4, heat)--> C6H5NO2 + H2O\n    Benzene                     Nitrobenzene\n    ```\n*   **Explanation:** Electrophilic aromatic substitution. The nitronium ion (NO2+) is the electrophile.\n\n**Step 2: Reduction of Nitrobenzene to Aniline**\n\n*   **Reagents and Conditions:** Tin (Sn) or Iron (Fe) and concentrated HCl (hydrochloric acid), followed by treatment with NaOH to neutralize the solution and liberate free aniline.\n*   **Reaction:** Nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline (phenylamine).\n    ```\n    C6H5NO2 + 6[H] --(Sn/HCl or Fe/HCl)--> C6H5NH2 + 2H2O\n    Nitrobenzene                   Aniline\n    ```\n*   **Explanation:** The metal (Sn or Fe) reduces the nitro group to an amino group.\n\n**Step 3: Diazotization of Aniline**\n\n*   **Reagents and Conditions:** NaNO2 (sodium nitrite) and HCl (hydrochloric acid) at low temperature (0-5\u00b0C).\n*   **Reaction:** Aniline reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, generated *in situ* from NaNO2 and HCl) to form benzenediazonium chloride.\n    ```\n    C6H5NH2 + NaNO2 + 2HCl --(0-5\u00b0C)--> C6H5N2+Cl- + NaCl + 2H2O\n    Aniline                     Benzenediazonium chloride\n    ```\n*   **Explanation:** This is a crucial step. The low temperature is essential to prevent decomposition of the diazonium salt.\n\n**Step 4: Replacement of the Diazonium Group with a Hydroxyl Group**\n\n*   **Reagents and Conditions:** Warm water or dilute acid.\n*   **Reaction:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to form phenol.\n    ```\n    C6H5N2+Cl- + H2O --(Warm)--> C6H5OH + N2 + HCl\n    Benzenediazonium chloride     Phenol\n    ```\n*   **Explanation:** The diazonium group is a very good leaving group, and it's readily replaced by a hydroxyl group upon warming with water.\n\n**Step 5: Bromination of Phenol**\n\n*   **Reagents and Conditions:** Bromine (Br2) in a solvent like carbon disulfide (CS2) or chloroform (CHCl3) at low temperature.\n*   **Reaction:** Phenol undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution with bromine, primarily at the *para* position.\n    ```\n    C6H5OH + Br2 --(CS2 or CHCl3, low temp)--> p-BrC6H4OH + HBr\n    Phenol                         p-Bromophenol\n    ```\n*   **Explanation:**  Since the OH group is strongly activating and *ortho/para*-directing, and since the *para* position is less sterically hindered, the *para* product predominates when the reaction is carried out under controlled conditions.\n\n**Why Direct Bromination of Phenol is Not Suitable for Obtaining *p*-Bromophenol in Good Yield**\n\nDirect bromination of phenol with bromine water (Br2/H2O) leads to polybromination (e.g., 2,4,6-tribromophenol) because the hydroxyl group is strongly activating. This makes the benzene ring highly susceptible to electrophilic attack at all *ortho* and *para* positions. It's very difficult to stop the reaction at the mono-brominated stage, and even harder to selectively obtain the *para* isomer.\n\nUsing Br2 in a less polar solvent like CS2 or CHCl3 and keeping the temperature low helps to slow down the reaction and favor mono-bromination. However, even under these conditions, some *ortho*-bromophenol will also be formed, and separation of the *ortho* and *para* isomers can be challenging. Therefore, the diazonium salt route provides a more controlled way to introduce the bromine atom specifically at the *para* position after creating the hydroxyl group.\n\n3.  **Basicity Comparison & Explanation:** Arrange the following compounds in decreasing order of basicity: ammonia, aniline, *p*-methylaniline, and *p*-nitroaniline. Provide a detailed explanation for your chosen order, considering the electronic effects of the substituents on the nitrogen atom.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the basicity comparison of the given compounds:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe compounds arranged in decreasing order of basicity are:\n\n*p*-methylaniline > ammonia > aniline > *p*-nitroaniline\n\nNow, let's delve into the explanation:\n\n**Understanding Basicity:**\n\nBasicity, in the context of amines, refers to the ability of the nitrogen atom's lone pair of electrons to accept a proton (H+).  A stronger base has a greater tendency to accept a proton, meaning the lone pair is more readily available. Several factors influence the availability of this lone pair, primarily electronic effects.\n\n**Factors Affecting Basicity:**\n\n1.  **+Inductive Effect (+I effect):** Alkyl groups are electron-donating groups, which exhibit a +I effect. They increase the electron density on the nitrogen atom, making the lone pair more available for protonation and thus increasing the basicity.\n\n2.  **-Inductive Effect (-I effect):** Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the electron density on the nitrogen atom, making the lone pair less available for protonation and thus decreasing the basicity.\n\n3.  **Resonance Effect (+R or -R effect):**  Resonance (also called mesomeric) effects can either increase (+R) or decrease (-R) the electron density on the nitrogen atom through delocalization of the lone pair into or away from the aromatic ring.\n\n**Explanation for the Order:**\n\n*   ***p*-methylaniline:** The methyl group (-CH3) is an electron-donating group (+I effect). When attached to the *para* position of aniline, it increases the electron density on the benzene ring and, consequently, on the nitrogen atom of the amine group. This makes the lone pair on nitrogen more available for protonation, making *p*-methylaniline the most basic among the given compounds.\n\n*   **Ammonia (NH3):** Ammonia serves as a reference point. It doesn't have any alkyl or aryl groups attached, so its basicity is determined solely by the availability of the lone pair on the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **Aniline (C6H5NH2):** In aniline, the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is delocalized into the benzene ring through resonance (+R effect). This delocalization decreases the electron density on the nitrogen atom, making the lone pair less available for protonation compared to ammonia. As a result, aniline is less basic than ammonia.\n\n*   ***p*-nitroaniline:** The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong electron-withdrawing group (-I and -R effects). When attached to the *para* position of aniline, it significantly decreases the electron density on the nitrogen atom due to resonance and inductive effects. The nitro group pulls electron density away from the ring and, consequently, from the nitrogen. This makes the lone pair on nitrogen *least* available for protonation, making *p*-nitroaniline the least basic among the given compounds.\n\n**In summary:** The basicity order is determined by the interplay of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects of the substituents on the aromatic ring. Electron-donating groups increase basicity, while electron-withdrawing groups decrease it. The resonance effect in aniline and the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group in *p*-nitroaniline are the dominant factors leading to their lower basicity compared to *p*-methylaniline and ammonia.\n",
        "model_answer": "### Summary ###\nSummary\n\n### Definitions ###\nOkay, here's a breakdown of the key concepts related to Amines and Diazonium Salts, designed to be helpful for understanding the NCERT chapter:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis chapter introduces amines and diazonium salts, two important classes of organic compounds. Amines are essentially derivatives of ammonia where hydrogen atoms are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. They are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on the number of substitutions. Diazonium salts, on the other hand, are formed from aromatic amines and are crucial intermediates in synthesizing various aromatic compounds, including dyes. The chapter covers their structure, classification, nomenclature, methods of preparation, physical and chemical properties, and applications.\n\n**Definitions (Key Concepts Explained Simply):**\n\n*   **Amines:** Think of ammonia (NH3). Now, imagine replacing one, two, or all three of the hydrogen atoms with carbon-containing groups (alkyl or aryl). What you get are amines. They're organic compounds with a nitrogen atom that has a lone pair of electrons, making them basic.\n\n*   **Primary (1\u00b0), Secondary (2\u00b0), and Tertiary (3\u00b0) Amines:** This classification is all about how many carbon groups are directly attached to the nitrogen atom in an amine. One carbon group means it's primary, two mean it's secondary, and three mean it's tertiary.\n\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature:** A systematic way of naming organic compounds. For amines, the basic alkane name is modified to indicate the presence and position of the amino (-NH2) group (e.g., methanamine, ethanamine). For secondary and tertiary amines, 'N' is used to show alkyl groups attached directly to the nitrogen.\n\n*   **Diazonium Salts:** These are special compounds formed from aromatic amines (like aniline). They have a diazonium group (N2+) attached to an aromatic ring. The 'diazo' part refers to the two nitrogens. These salts are useful because the diazonium group can be easily replaced with other atoms or groups, allowing for the synthesis of many different aromatic compounds.\n\n*   **Diazotization:** The process of converting a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. This usually involves reacting the amine with nitrous acid (HNO2) at low temperatures (around 0-5\u00b0C).\n\n*   **Sandmeyer Reaction:** A reaction where the diazonium group in a diazonium salt is replaced by a halide (Cl, Br) or cyanide (CN) in the presence of a copper(I) salt (e.g., CuCl, CuBr, CuCN).\n\n*   **Gattermann Reaction:**  Similar to the Sandmeyer reaction, but uses copper powder and a halogen acid (HCl or HBr) instead of a copper(I) salt to replace the diazonium group with chlorine or bromine.\n\n*   **Coupling Reaction:** A reaction where a diazonium salt reacts with another aromatic compound (like a phenol or another aromatic amine) to form an azo compound (R-N=N-R'). Azo compounds are often brightly colored and used as dyes.\n\n*   **Basicity of Amines:** Amines are basic because the nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons that can accept a proton. Aliphatic amines (those with alkyl groups) are generally more basic than ammonia, while aromatic amines (like aniline) are less basic due to the lone pair being delocalized into the aromatic ring.\n\n**Solved Example:**\n\n**Problem:** Convert butanoic acid to butan-1-amine.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n**Step 1: Convert the carboxylic acid to an amide.**\n\n*   React butanoic acid with ammonia (NH3) and heat. This will form butanamide.\n    ```\n    CH3CH2CH2COOH + NH3  -> CH3CH2CH2CONH2 + H2O\n    Butanoic acid                   Butanamide\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Perform Hoffmann Bromamide Degradation.**\n\n*   Treat the butanamide with bromine (Br2) in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH).  This will degrade the amide, removing one carbon atom and forming butan-1-amine.\n    ```\n    CH3CH2CH2CONH2 + Br2 + 4NaOH -> CH3CH2CH2NH2 + Na2CO3 + 2NaBr + 2H2O\n    Butanamide                       Butan-1-amine\n    ```\n\n**Explanation:** The Hoffmann bromamide degradation reaction is key here. It shortens the carbon chain by one carbon, allowing us to go from a four-carbon amide to a three-carbon amine.\n\nI hope this is helpful!\n\n### Solved Examples ###\nLike ammonia, nitrogen atom of amines is trivalent and\nof arylamine.
