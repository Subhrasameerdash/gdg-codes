        "student_answer": "1.  **Falling Ball Rebound:** A ball is dropped from a height of 10 meters. After each bounce, it rebounds to a height that is two-thirds of the height of the previous bounce. Determine the total vertical distance the ball travels before coming to rest.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the \"Falling Ball Rebound\" question, designed for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo determine the total vertical distance traveled by the ball, we need to consider both the distances it falls and the distances it rebounds. This problem can be elegantly solved using the concept of an infinite geometric progression.\n\n**1. Distance Fallen:**\n\n*   The ball initially falls 10 meters.\n*   After the first bounce, it falls again from a height of (2/3) * 10 meters.\n*   After the second bounce, it falls from a height of (2/3)<sup>2</sup> * 10 meters, and so on.\n\nThis forms an infinite geometric progression: 10, (2/3)*10, (2/3)<sup>2</sup>*10, ...\n\nHere, the first term, *a* = 10, and the common ratio, *r* = 2/3.  Since |r| = 2/3 < 1, we can find the sum to infinity.\n\nThe total distance the ball falls is given by:\n\nS<sub>\u221e(down)</sub> = a / (1 - r) = 10 / (1 - 2/3) = 10 / (1/3) = 30 meters.\n\n**2. Distance Rebounded:**\n\n*   The ball first rebounds to a height of (2/3) * 10 meters.\n*   Then it rebounds to a height of (2/3)<sup>2</sup> * 10 meters, and so on.\n\nThis *also* forms an infinite geometric progression: (2/3)*10, (2/3)<sup>2</sup>*10, (2/3)<sup>3</sup>*10, ...\n\nHere, the first term, *a* = (2/3) * 10 = 20/3, and the common ratio, *r* = 2/3.  Again, |r| < 1.\n\nThe total distance the ball rebounds is given by:\n\nS<sub>\u221e(up)</sub> = a / (1 - r) = (20/3) / (1 - 2/3) = (20/3) / (1/3) = 20 meters.\n\n**3. Total Distance Traveled:**\n\nThe total vertical distance is the sum of the distance fallen and the distance rebounded:\n\nTotal Distance = S<sub>\u221e(down)</sub> + S<sub>\u221e(up)</sub> = 30 meters + 20 meters = 50 meters.\n\n**Therefore, the total vertical distance the ball travels before coming to rest is 50 meters.**\n\n**Explanation of Concepts Used:**\n\n*   **Geometric Progression (G.P.):** We identified that the distances fallen and rebounded formed a geometric progression, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio.\n*   **Infinite Geometric Progression:** Since the ball continues to bounce indefinitely (theoretically), we dealt with an infinite G.P.\n*   **Sum to Infinity:** We used the formula for the sum to infinity (S<sub>\u221e</sub> = a / (1 - r)) because the common ratio (2/3) had an absolute value less than 1, ensuring that the sum converges to a finite value.\n*   **Breaking Down the Problem:** We separated the problem into two parts (distance fallen and distance rebounded) to make it easier to apply the G.P. formula. This is a common problem-solving strategy.\n\n2.  **Radioactive Decay:** A radioactive substance decays in such a way that after each year, only 90% of the substance remains. If you start with 100 grams of the substance, use logarithmic principles to estimate how many years it will take for the amount of the substance to fall below 50 grams. (Hint: you may leave your answer in terms of logarithms).\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT content and tailored to address the radioactive decay problem. It includes explanations and focuses on clarity.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe're dealing with radioactive decay, where the amount of a substance decreases exponentially over time.  We know that each year, only 90% of the substance remains. This means we can model the amount of the substance remaining after *t* years using an exponential function. Our goal is to find the time (*t*) when the amount falls below 50 grams, starting from 100 grams. We'll use logarithms to solve for *t*.\n\n**Setting up the Equation:**\n\nLet A(t) be the amount of the radioactive substance remaining after *t* years. We can express A(t) as:\n\nA(t) = A<sub>0</sub> * (0.90)<sup>t</sup>\n\nWhere:\n\n*   A(t) is the amount remaining after *t* years\n*   A<sub>0</sub> is the initial amount (100 grams in this case)\n*   0.90 is the decay factor (since 90% remains each year)\n*   t is the time in years\n\nWe want to find the value of *t* when A(t) < 50 grams. So, we set up the inequality:\n\n50 > 100 * (0.90)<sup>t</sup>\n\n**Solving the Inequality:**\n\n1.  **Divide both sides by 100:**\n\n    0.  5 > (0.90)<sup>t</sup>\n\n2.  **Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n\n    ln(0.5) > ln((0.90)<sup>t</sup>)\n\n    *Important Note:* We use the natural logarithm (ln) because it's closely related to exponential functions, as mentioned in the NCERT material. Taking the logarithm of both sides allows us to bring the exponent down.\n\n3.  **Use the logarithm power rule (ln(a<sup>b</sup>) = b * ln(a)):**\n\n    ln(0.5) > t * ln(0.90)\n\n4.  **Isolate *t* by dividing both sides by ln(0.90):**\n\n    t < ln(0.5) / ln(0.90)\n\n    *Important Note:* Since ln(0.90) is negative (because 0.90 is less than 1), we need to *flip* the inequality sign when dividing:\n    t > ln(0.5) / ln(0.90)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nTherefore, it will take *t* > ln(0.5) / ln(0.90) years for the amount of the substance to fall below 50 grams. You can leave the answer in this form, as requested in the prompt.\n\n**Explanation of Key Steps and Connections to NCERT Content:**\n\n*   **Exponential Decay Model:** The equation A(t) = A<sub>0</sub> * (0.90)<sup>t</sup> represents exponential decay, which is a direct application of exponential functions discussed in the NCERT chapter.\n*   **Using Logarithms:** We use logarithms to solve for *t* because *t* is in the exponent. This is a standard technique when dealing with exponential equations and connects directly to the logarithmic function concepts and their properties described in the NCERT material.\n*   **Natural Logarithm (ln):** While other logarithms could be used, the natural logarithm (ln) is often preferred in calculus and sciences due to its direct relationship with the exponential function *e*<sup>x</sup>.  The chapter emphasizes *e*<sup>x</sup> and ln(x), making it a natural choice.\n*   **Inequality Sign Flip:** It's crucial to remember to flip the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number (ln(0.90) is negative).  This is a fundamental rule of inequalities.\n*   **Leaving the Answer in Terms of Logarithms:** The problem instruction allows for the answer to be left in terms of logartihms which makes it easier.\n\nThis answer provides a clear, step-by-step solution to the problem, connects it to the relevant concepts covered in the NCERT chapter (exponential and logarithmic functions), and includes explanations to enhance understanding. The student can further evaluate the expression ln(0.5) / ln(0.90) using a calculator to get an approximate numerical value for *t* (which would be approximately 6.58 years).\n\n3.  **Limit Manipulation:** Evaluate the limit: lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 [e^(3x) - 1] / sin(2x). You must show all steps and justify the use of any standard limits.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the limit problem:\n\n**Question:** Evaluate the limit: lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 [e^(3x) - 1] / sin(2x). You must show all steps and justify the use of any standard limits.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo evaluate the limit lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 [e^(3x) - 1] / sin(2x), we'll use algebraic manipulation and known standard limits related to exponential and trigonometric functions.\n\n**Step 1: Recognize the need for standard limits**\n\nThe expression contains an exponential term (e^(3x)) and a trigonometric term (sin(2x)). We should aim to rewrite the expression to resemble the standard limits:\n\n*   lim<sub>x\u21920</sub> (e<sup>x</sup> - 1) / x = 1\n*   lim<sub>x\u21920</sub> sin(x) / x = 1   (This can also be written as lim<sub>x\u21920</sub> x / sin(x) = 1)\n\n**Step 2: Manipulate the expression**\n\nOur goal is to get terms like (e^(3x) - 1) / (3x) and sin(2x) / (2x) to appear in the expression.  To do this, we multiply and divide by appropriate factors:\n\n```\nlim \u2093\u2192\u2080 [e^(3x) - 1] / sin(2x)  =  lim \u2093\u2192\u2080  [ (e^(3x) - 1) / sin(2x) ] * [ (3x) / (3x) ] * [ (2x) / (2x) ]\n```\n\nRearranging the terms:\n\n```\n=  lim \u2093\u2192\u2080  [ (e^(3x) - 1) / (3x) ]  *  [ (2x) / sin(2x) ] * [ (3x) / (2x) ]\n```\n\n**Step 3: Separate the limit and apply standard limits**\n\nWe can separate the limit of the product into the product of the limits (provided each limit exists):\n\n```\n=  [ lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 (e^(3x) - 1) / (3x) ]  *  [ lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 (2x) / sin(2x) ]  *  [ lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 (3x) / (2x) ]\n```\n\nNow, let's evaluate each limit:\n\n*   **Limit 1:**  lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 (e^(3x) - 1) / (3x)\n\n    Let y = 3x.  As x approaches 0, y also approaches 0.  So we can rewrite this as:\n\n    lim <sub>y\u2192\u2080</sub> (e<sup>y</sup> - 1) / y = 1  (Using the standard limit)\n\n*   **Limit 2:** lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 (2x) / sin(2x)\n\n    Let z = 2x. As x approaches 0, z also approaches 0.  So we can rewrite this as:\n\n    lim <sub>z\u2192\u2080</sub> z / sin(z) = 1 (Using the standard limit).\n\n*   **Limit 3:** lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 (3x) / (2x)\n\n    This is a simple algebraic simplification:\n\n    lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 (3x) / (2x) = lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 3/2 = 3/2\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results**\n\nSubstituting the values of the individual limits back into the expression:\n\n```\n=  [1] * [1] * [3/2]  =  3/2\n```\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, lim \u2093\u2192\u2080 [e^(3x) - 1] / sin(2x) = 3/2.\n\n**Key points highlighted in the answer:**\n\n*   **Recognition of Standard Limits:** Clearly identifies the relevant standard limits that will be used.\n*   **Substitution (where appropriate):** Shows the substitution to align the given limit *exactly* with the standard limit.  This clarifies the application of the standard limit.\n*   **Step-by-step Manipulation:** Demonstrates the algebraic steps involved in transforming the expression into a form where standard limits can be applied.\n*   **Justification:** Explicitly states the use of the standard limits and justifies the variable substitutions, ensuring clarity and rigor.\n*   **Clear Conclusion:** States the final answer clearly.\n*   **Appropriate Language:** Uses mathematical language and notation suitable for the intended audience.\n",
        "model_answer": "### Summary ###\nOkay, here's a breakdown of the concepts from the provided NCERT material, explained in a way that avoids direct copying and is suitable for educational purposes:\n\n**1. Infinite Geometric Progressions (G.P.) and Their Sum**\n\n*   **What it is:** An infinite G.P. is simply a geometric progression (a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous one by a constant ratio) that goes on forever.  For example: 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8,...\n\n*   **Sum to Infinity:**  The cool thing is that sometimes, even though you're adding infinitely many terms, the sum approaches a finite number.  This happens when the common ratio (r) between terms is between -1 and 1 (i.e., its absolute value is less than 1: |r| < 1).\n\n*   **Formula:** If |r| < 1, the sum to infinity (S<sub>\u221e</sub>) of a G.P. is given by:\n\n    S<sub>\u221e</sub> = a / (1 - r)\n\n    where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.\n\n**2. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions and Limits**\n\n*   **Exponential Function:** The exponential function, *e*<sup>x</sup>, is a function where *e* (Euler's number, approximately 2.71828) is raised to the power of *x*. The domain is all real numbers, and the range is all positive real numbers.\n\n*   **Logarithmic Function:** The logarithmic function, log<sub>*e*</sub>(*x*) or ln(*x*) , is the inverse of the exponential function. It asks the question: \"To what power must we raise *e* to get *x*?\".  The domain is all positive real numbers, and the range is all real numbers.\n\n*   **Key Limits:** Two important limits involving these functions are:\n\n    *   lim<sub>x\u21920</sub> (*e*<sup>x</sup> - 1) / *x* = 1\n    *   lim<sub>x\u21920</sub> ln(1 + *x*) / *x* = 1\n\n    These limits are fundamental for calculus involving exponential and logarithmic functions.\n\n**Solved Example (Infinite G.P.):**\n\n**Problem:** Find the sum to infinity of the geometric progression: 3, 1, 1/3, 1/9, ...\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Identify 'a' and 'r':**\n    *   The first term, a = 3\n    *   The common ratio, r = 1/3 (because 1/3 * 3 = 1, 1/3 * 1= 1/3, and so on)\n\n2.  **Check |r| < 1:**\n    *   |1/3| < 1, so we *can* use the sum to infinity formula.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula:**\n    *   S<sub>\u221e</sub> = a / (1 - r) = 3 / (1 - 1/3) = 3 / (2/3) = 3 * (3/2) = 9/2 = 4.5\n\n**Therefore, the sum to infinity of the G.P. 3, 1, 1/3, 1/9, ... is 4.5**\n\n### Definitions ###\nOkay, here's a breakdown of the concepts, definitions, and an example problem related to infinite geometric progressions and exponential/logarithmic limits, explained in a way suitable for NCERT-level understanding:\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis section covers two main ideas:\n\n1.  **Infinite Geometric Progressions (G.P.):**  We explore what happens when you add up *infinite* terms of a G.P.  Sometimes, this sum approaches a specific value (if the common ratio is between -1 and 1). We learn how to calculate this sum to infinity.\n\n2.  **Limits of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:** We look at how exponential functions (like *e*<sup>*x*</sup>) and logarithmic functions (like log<sub>e</sub> *x*, also written as ln *x*) behave as *x* approaches certain values, especially 0. We use important standard limits to evaluate more complex limit problems involving these functions.\n\n**Definitions**\n\n*   **Infinite Geometric Progression:** A geometric progression is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant value (the common ratio, *r*). An infinite G.P. is simply a G.P. that goes on forever.  For example: 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ... is an infinite G.P. with *r* = 1/2.\n\n*   **Sum to Infinity (S<sub>\u221e</sub>):**  If the absolute value of the common ratio *r* is less than 1 (i.e., -1 < *r* < 1), then the sum of an infinite G.P. approaches a finite value.  This value is called the sum to infinity and is calculated as:\n\n    S<sub>\u221e</sub> = a / (1 - r)\n\n    where 'a' is the first term of the G.P.\n\n*   **The Number 'e':** This is a special irrational number, approximately equal to 2.71828. It's the base of the natural logarithm and appears frequently in calculus and exponential functions.\n\n*   **Exponential Function:** A function of the form f(x) = e<sup>x</sup>, where 'e' is the base and 'x' is the exponent. Its graph increases rapidly as x increases.\n\n*   **Logarithmic Function:** The inverse of the exponential function.  The natural logarithm, denoted as ln(x) or log<sub>e</sub>(x), answers the question: \"To what power must I raise 'e' to get x?\".  Its graph increases slowly as x increases.\n\n*   **Limit:** The value that a function \"approaches\" as the input (x) approaches some value.\n\n*   **Standard Limits:** These are pre-established limit results that are used to solve problems. Two important standard limits covered here are:\n\n    *   lim<sub>x\u21920</sub> (e<sup>x</sup> - 1) / x = 1\n    *   lim<sub>x\u21920</sub> ln(1 + x) / x = 1\n\n**Solved Example**\n\n**Problem:** Find the sum to infinity of the geometric progression: 4, -2, 1, -1/2, ...\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Identify 'a' and 'r':**\n    *   The first term, *a*, is 4.\n    *   The common ratio, *r*, is found by dividing any term by its preceding term.  For example, r = -2 / 4 = -1/2.\n\n2.  **Check if |r| < 1:**\n    *   The absolute value of *r* is |-1/2| = 1/2, which is less than 1. So, we *can* find the sum to infinity.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula:**\n    *   S<sub>\u221e</sub> = a / (1 - r) = 4 / (1 - (-1/2)) = 4 / (1 + 1/2) = 4 / (3/2) = 4 * (2/3) = 8/3\n\nTherefore, the sum to infinity of the given geometric progression is 8/3.\n\n### Solved Examples ###\nLet us consider the G.P.,\n2\n4\n1,\n,\n, ...\n3\n9\nCompute \n3\n0\n1\nCompute \n0\nEvaluate\n1\n\n### Exercises ###\n8.3\n13.2\n\n"
