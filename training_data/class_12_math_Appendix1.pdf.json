        "student_answer": "1.  Given the statement \"If a matrix A is invertible, then A is non-singular,\" explain why proving the contrapositive of this statement is a valid method to establish its truth. Illustrate with a brief example of a 2x2 matrix.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student based on the provided NCERT chapter content, explaining the validity of using the contrapositive to prove a statement and illustrating with a 2x2 matrix example:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe statement \"If a matrix A is invertible, then A is non-singular\" is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n\n*   P: A is invertible\n*   Q: A is non-singular\n\nProving the contrapositive is a valid method because a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the contrapositive is true, then the original statement is also true, and vice-versa. The contrapositive of the statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn our case, the contrapositive of the statement \"If a matrix A is invertible, then A is non-singular\" is:\n\n**\"If a matrix A is singular, then A is not invertible.\"**\n\nSo, instead of directly showing that every invertible matrix is non-singular, we can show that every singular matrix is *not* invertible.  This is often easier because singularity is directly related to the determinant.\n\n**Why this works (Explanation):**\n\n*   **Singular Matrix:** A matrix is singular if its determinant is zero.  A matrix is non-singular if its determinant is non-zero.\n*   **Invertible Matrix:** A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero.\n*   **The connection:** Therefore, if the determinant of A is zero (A is singular), then A cannot have an inverse (A is not invertible). Conversely, if A is not invertible, then its determinant must be zero, making it singular.\n\n**Example (2x2 Matrix):**\n\nLet's consider a 2x2 matrix A:\n\nA =  | a  b |\n     | c  d |\n\nThe determinant of A, denoted as det(A), is calculated as:  det(A) = ad - bc\n\n1.  **Assume A is singular:** This means det(A) = ad - bc = 0.\n\n2.  **Show A is not invertible:** If A were invertible, it would have an inverse matrix, A<sup>-1</sup>. The product of a matrix and its inverse is the identity matrix (I). However, if det(A) = 0, then no such inverse matrix A<sup>-1</sup> exists. This can be seen from the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:\n\n    A<sup>-1</sup> = (1/det(A)) *  |  d  -b |\n                         | -c   a |\n\n    If det(A) = 0, then we are dividing by zero, which is undefined.  Therefore, if A is singular (det(A) = 0), then A is not invertible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy proving the contrapositive \"If a matrix A is singular, then A is not invertible,\" we have logically demonstrated the truth of the original statement: \"If a matrix A is invertible, then A is non-singular.\" This is a valid and often useful technique in mathematical proofs. The example helps to illustrate this by demonstrating how a singular matrix cannot have an inverse, thereby validating the contrapositive.\n\n2.  Construct a counterexample to disprove the statement: \"For all real numbers *x*, if *x* > 0, then *x\u00b2* > *x*.\" Explain why your example serves as a counterexample.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nA counterexample is a specific example that demonstrates that a general statement is false.  To disprove the statement \"For all real numbers *x*, if *x* > 0, then *x\u00b2* > *x*\", we need to find a real number *x* that is greater than 0, but for which *x\u00b2* is *not* greater than *x*.\n\nConsider the real number *x* = 0.5 (which is equal to 1/2).\n\n*   *x* > 0:  0.5 is indeed greater than 0.\n\n*   *x\u00b2* > *x*?:  Let's calculate *x\u00b2*:  (0.5)\u00b2 = 0.25\n\nNow, compare *x\u00b2* and *x*:  0.25 is *not* greater than 0.5. In fact, 0.25 is *less than* 0.5.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe statement claims that *for all* positive real numbers, squaring the number will always result in a larger number. Our counterexample, *x* = 0.5, demonstrates that this is not true.  When we square 0.5, we get 0.25, which is smaller than 0.5.  Therefore, *x* = 0.5 is a counterexample that disproves the given statement because it satisfies the condition *x* > 0 but fails to satisfy the condition *x\u00b2* > *x*. The original statement is therefore false. It only holds true for real numbers greater than 1.\n\n3.  Describe the differences in methodology and purpose between a direct proof and proof by contradiction. Provide a hypothetical mathematical statement and outline how you would approach proving it using *both* methods.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for a CBSE class 11-12 student audience and drawing upon the provided NCERT chapter content.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nA direct proof and proof by contradiction are two fundamental techniques used to establish the validity of mathematical statements. While both aim to demonstrate the truth of a statement, they differ significantly in their methodology and underlying logic.\n\n**Direct Proof:**\n\n*   **Methodology:** A direct proof starts by assuming the hypothesis (the 'if' part of a statement) is true. It then uses a series of logical deductions, definitions, previously proven theorems (axioms), and established rules of inference to arrive directly at the conclusion (the 'then' part of the statement). It's a straightforward, step-by-step process.\n*   **Purpose:** The purpose of a direct proof is to build a clear, explicit chain of reasoning that directly links the hypothesis to the conclusion. It aims to show *why* the conclusion necessarily follows from the hypothesis.\n*   **Example from NCERT Content:** While the provided examples demonstrate various proofs, the \"direct method\" is explicitly mentioned. Example 6, the proof that `f(x) = 2x + 5` is one-one, likely follows a direct approach although the complete steps are not included.\n\n**Proof by Contradiction:**\n\n*   **Methodology:** A proof by contradiction (also known as *reductio ad absurdum*) begins by assuming the *negation* of the statement we want to prove is true. We then use logical deductions, axioms, and theorems to derive a contradiction \u2013 a statement that is inherently false (e.g., 1 = 0, or a statement that contradicts a known axiom or theorem). Since our initial assumption led to a contradiction, we conclude that the negation of the original statement must be false. Therefore, the original statement itself must be true.\n*   **Purpose:** Proof by contradiction is useful when a direct proof is difficult or impossible to construct. It's often used to prove statements that assert the impossibility of something. It shows that *if* the statement were false, it would lead to an absurd result.\n*   **Example from NCERT Content:** Example 5, showing that the set of all prime numbers is infinite, is a classic example of a proof by contradiction. Although the detailed steps are missing, this is a typical application.\n\n**Hypothetical Mathematical Statement and Approaches:**\n\nLet's consider the following statement:\n\n\"If *x* is an even integer, then *x*<sup>2</sup> is an even integer.\"\n\n**Direct Proof:**\n\n1.  **Assume the hypothesis:** Assume *x* is an even integer.\n2.  **Definition of even integer:** By definition, an even integer can be written as *x* = 2*k*, where *k* is some integer.\n3.  **Square x:**  *x*<sup>2</sup> = (2*k*)<sup>2</sup> = 4*k*<sup>2</sup>.\n4.  **Rewrite:** *x*<sup>2</sup> = 2(2*k*<sup>2</sup>).\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since 2*k*<sup>2</sup> is an integer (because *k* is an integer), *x*<sup>2</sup> is of the form 2 times an integer. Therefore, *x*<sup>2</sup> is an even integer.\n\n**Proof by Contradiction:**\n\n1.  **Assume the negation:** Assume the statement is false. That is, assume *x* is an even integer, *and x*<sup>2</sup> is *not* an even integer (i.e., *x*<sup>2</sup> is odd).\n2.  **Definition of even integer:** Since *x* is even, *x* = 2*k* for some integer *k*.\n3.  **Square x:** *x*<sup>2</sup> = (2*k*)<sup>2</sup> = 4*k*<sup>2</sup> = 2(2*k*<sup>2</sup>).\n4.  **Deduction:** From the result we can see that *x*<sup>2</sup> is even.\n5.  **Contradiction:** This contradicts our initial assumption that *x*<sup>2</sup> is *not* an even integer.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since our initial assumption led to a contradiction, the negation of the original statement must be false. Therefore, the original statement, \"If *x* is an even integer, then *x*<sup>2</sup> is an even integer,\" is true.\n\nIn summary, direct proofs provide a clear path from hypothesis to conclusion, while proofs by contradiction demonstrate the truth of a statement by showing that its negation leads to an absurdity. Choosing the appropriate method depends on the specific statement being proven and the ease with which each method can be applied.\n",

        "feedback": "No feedback provided.\nOkay, let's evaluate the student's answer.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts of contrapositive proofs, counterexamples, direct proofs, and proof by contradiction. The explanations are generally clear, and the student provides relevant examples. The answers are well-structured and follow a logical flow.  The framing as \"sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student\" is a little unnecessary and repetitive, but doesn't detract significantly from the quality of the response.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n**Question 1: Contrapositive Proof (Invertible Matrices)**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The explanation of why the contrapositive works (logical equivalence) is accurate. The connection between singular matrices, determinants, and invertibility is also correctly explained. The example 2x2 matrix provides a good illustration.\n*   **Clarity:** The explanation is very clear and easy to follow, even for someone not intimately familiar with linear algebra. The breakdown of P and Q and \"not Q, then not P\" is well done.\n*   **Structure:** The answer is well-structured. It starts with the definition of the contrapositive, explains the logic, provides the contrapositive statement, gives an explanation of why it works, and then offers a concrete example.\n*   **Strengths:** Excellent explanation of logical equivalence and clear link between invertibility and determinants. The example provides concrete understanding.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** While good, the example could be slightly more rigorous. For example, it mentions that *if* an inverse existed, the formula would involve division by zero.  It could more explicitly state that since the determinant is zero, the formula *is* undefined, hence no inverse *can* exist.\n\n**Question 2: Counterexample**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The answer is perfectly accurate. The choice of x = 0.5 as a counterexample is correct, and the explanation of why it disproves the statement is also correct.\n*   **Clarity:**  The explanation is clear and straightforward.  The step-by-step calculation is helpful.\n*   **Structure:** The answer is well-structured, starting with a definition of a counterexample, then presenting the chosen example, and finally explaining why it works.\n*   **Strengths:** Clear explanation of the concept of a counterexample and effective choice of a counterexample that is easy to understand.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** None significant.\n\n**Question 3: Direct Proof vs. Proof by Contradiction**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The descriptions of direct proof and proof by contradiction are accurate. The example statement \"If *x* is an even integer, then *x*<sup>2</sup> is an even integer\" is a good choice.  The direct proof is correct. The proof by contradiction is also logically correct, although arguably slightly less elegant than it could be.\n*   **Clarity:** The explanations of the methodologies and purposes of each type of proof are well-written and easy to understand.\n*   **Structure:** The answer is well-organized, with clear headings for each proof type and a logical flow of ideas.\n*   **Strengths:** Good explanation of the differences between the two proof methods. Effective and relevant example statement.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** The proof by contradiction could be streamlined.  Instead of stating \"From the result we can see that x^2 is even\", it would be stronger to directly state:  \"But x = 2k, therefore x^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2), which is even. This contradicts our assumption that x^2 is odd.\"\n\n\n\n**Justification:**\n\nThe student demonstrates a solid grasp of the concepts and provides clear, well-structured answers. The explanations are accurate, and the examples are relevant. There are only minor areas for improvement in terms of rigor and elegance in some of the examples. The slightly repetitive framing of the answers as \"sample answers\" is the only significant stylistic flaw. The excellent understanding and explanation of core mathematical concepts warrant a high score and an A grade."
