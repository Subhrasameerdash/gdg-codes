        "student_answer": "1.  **Conceptual Application:** A simple pendulum is set into oscillation. Describe how the period of oscillation changes (if at all) when:\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student regarding the factors affecting the period of a simple pendulum:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet's analyze how the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum changes under different conditions.  It's important to remember the formula for the period of a simple pendulum, which is an approximation valid for small angles of oscillation:\n\nT = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g)\n\nWhere:\n\n*   T is the period of oscillation\n*   L is the length of the pendulum\n*   g is the acceleration due to gravity\n\nNow, let's consider the scenarios:\n\n**(a) The length of the pendulum is increased:**\n\nAccording to the formula, the period (T) is directly proportional to the square root of the length (L). This means that if the length of the pendulum *increases*, the period of oscillation will also *increase*.  A longer pendulum will swing more slowly, taking more time to complete one full oscillation.\n\n**(b) The mass of the bob is increased:**\n\nLooking at the formula, we can see that the mass of the bob (the object at the end of the string) *does not appear* in the equation for the period.  Therefore, changing the mass of the bob *does not affect* the period of oscillation (assuming we are still within the small angle approximation). This is a crucial point to understand.  The period depends on the restoring force *per unit mass*, and while a heavier bob experiences a greater gravitational force, it also has greater inertia, exactly cancelling out the effect on the period.\n\n**(c) The initial angle of swing is increased significantly (beyond the small angle approximation):**\n\nThe formula T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g) is derived using the small angle approximation (sin \u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8).  This approximation holds true for angles less than about 15 degrees. When the initial angle of swing is significantly increased (e.g., to 45 degrees or more), the small angle approximation is no longer valid. In this case, the period of oscillation will *increase* with increasing amplitude. This is because the restoring force is no longer strictly proportional to the displacement. The pendulum will spend more time at the extremes of its swing.\n\n**(d) The pendulum is moved to a location with a higher gravitational acceleration (g):**\n\nThe period (T) is inversely proportional to the square root of the acceleration due to gravity (g).  Therefore, if the pendulum is moved to a location with *higher* 'g' (for example, a location closer to the Earth's center or on a planet with a higher density), the period of oscillation will *decrease*.  The pendulum will swing faster.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **Length Increased:** Period increases.\n*   **Mass Increased:** Period remains the same (within the small angle approximation).\n*   **Angle Increased (significantly):** Period increases.\n*   **Gravitational Acceleration Increased:** Period decreases.\n\n2.  **Energy and SHM:** A block attached to a spring oscillates horizontally on a frictionless surface. At what displacement from the equilibrium position is the block's kinetic energy equal to its potential energy? Express your answer as a fraction or percentage of the amplitude of oscillation. Justify your answer using the principles of energy conservation in SHM.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the assignment question about energy and SHM:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nWhen a block attached to a spring oscillates horizontally in Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) on a frictionless surface, its total energy (E) is constantly being exchanged between kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE). The total energy remains constant because there is no friction to dissipate it.\n\n*   **Total Energy (E):**  E = KE + PE\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy (KE):** KE = (1/2)mv\u00b2, where *m* is the mass of the block and *v* is its velocity.\n\n*   **Potential Energy (PE):** PE = (1/2)kx\u00b2, where *k* is the spring constant and *x* is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nWe want to find the displacement (*x*) at which KE = PE.  Let's set up the equation:\n\n(1/2)mv\u00b2 = (1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nWe know that the total energy (E) can also be expressed in terms of the amplitude (A) as:\n\nE = (1/2)kA\u00b2  (This is the potential energy when the block is at its maximum displacement, which is the amplitude.)\n\nSince E = KE + PE, and we want to find when KE = PE, then at that point:\n\nE = PE + PE = 2PE   or   E = KE + KE = 2KE\n\nLet's use E = 2PE:\n\n(1/2)kA\u00b2 = 2 * (1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nkA\u00b2 = 2kx\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by *k*:\n\nA\u00b2 = 2x\u00b2\n\nNow, solve for *x*:\n\nx\u00b2 = A\u00b2/2\n\nx = \u00b1\u221a(A\u00b2/2)\n\nx = \u00b1 A/\u221a2\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply by \u221a2/\u221a2:\n\nx = \u00b1 (A\u221a2)/2\n\n**Therefore, the block's kinetic energy is equal to its potential energy at a displacement of  \u00b1(A\u221a2)/2 from the equilibrium position.**\n\n**As a fraction of the amplitude:** The displacement is \u221a2/2  times the amplitude.\n\n**As a percentage of the amplitude:** (\u221a2/2) * 100% \u2248 70.7% of the amplitude.\n\n**Justification using Energy Conservation:**\n\nThe total energy in SHM remains constant.  When the block is at its maximum displacement (x = A), all the energy is stored as potential energy in the spring, and the kinetic energy is zero.  As the block moves towards the equilibrium position, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. At the equilibrium position (x = 0), all the energy is kinetic, and the potential energy is zero. The point where KE = PE represents the halfway point in this energy conversion process, not in terms of distance, but in terms of energy distribution. The derivation above mathematically shows that this occurs at x = \u00b1 A/\u221a2.\n\n3.  **Graphical Analysis and SHM:** A student plots the displacement of an object undergoing Simple Harmonic Motion as a function of time. From the graph, they determine the amplitude to be 5 cm and the period to be 2 seconds.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, designed for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided chapter content.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet's analyze the Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) described by the student's graph, where the amplitude (A) is 5 cm and the period (T) is 2 seconds.  We'll use this information to fully characterize the motion.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Given Information:**\n\n    *   **Amplitude (A) = 5 cm = 0.05 m:**  This is the maximum displacement of the object from its equilibrium position. Remember to convert to meters for consistency in calculations!\n    *   **Period (T) = 2 s:** This is the time it takes for the object to complete one full cycle of oscillation.\n\n2.  **Calculating Frequency (\u03bd) and Angular Frequency (\u03c9):**\n\n    *   **Frequency (\u03bd):**  The frequency is the inverse of the period:\n        \u03bd = 1/T = 1/2 s = 0.5 Hz.  This means the object completes half an oscillation every second.\n\n    *   **Angular Frequency (\u03c9):**  The angular frequency is related to the frequency by:\n        \u03c9 = 2\u03c0\u03bd = 2\u03c0(0.5 Hz) = \u03c0 rad/s  (approximately 3.14 rad/s).  Angular frequency tells us how quickly the object is oscillating in terms of radians per second.\n\n3.  **General Equation for SHM:**\n\n    The displacement of an object undergoing SHM can be described by a sinusoidal function (either sine or cosine):\n\n    *   x(t) = A cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6)  or  x(t) = A sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6)\n\n    Where:\n        *   x(t) is the displacement at time t\n        *   A is the amplitude\n        *   \u03c9 is the angular frequency\n        *   t is the time\n        *   \u03c6 is the phase constant (initial phase)\n\n4.  **Determining the Phase Constant (\u03c6):**\n\n    To write the *specific* equation for this SHM, we need to determine the phase constant, \u03c6.  This requires knowing the object's position at time t = 0.  Since this information is not given in the question, we can only provide general equations.\n\n    *   **If the object is at its maximum displacement (x = A) at t = 0:** This means we can use a cosine function with \u03c6 = 0:  x(t) = A cos(\u03c9t)  = 0.05 cos(\u03c0t) meters\n\n    *   **If the object is at its equilibrium position (x = 0) at t = 0:** This means we can use a sine function with \u03c6 = 0: x(t) = A sin(\u03c9t) = 0.05 sin(\u03c0t) meters\n\n    *   **In general:** Without knowing the initial conditions (position and velocity at t=0), we cannot determine *\u03c6* precisely. We would need to read the value off the graph provided by the student.\n\n5.  **Velocity and Acceleration in SHM:**\n\n    Once we have the displacement equation, we can find the velocity and acceleration as functions of time:\n\n    *   **Velocity (v(t)):** The velocity is the time derivative of the displacement:\n\n        * If x(t) = A cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6), then v(t) = -A\u03c9 sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6)\n        * If x(t) = A sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6), then v(t) = A\u03c9 cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6)\n\n    *   **Acceleration (a(t)):** The acceleration is the time derivative of the velocity (or the second derivative of the displacement):\n\n        * If x(t) = A cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6), then a(t) = -A\u03c9<sup>2</sup> cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6)  = -\u03c9<sup>2</sup>x(t)\n        * If x(t) = A sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6), then a(t) = -A\u03c9<sup>2</sup> sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6) = -\u03c9<sup>2</sup>x(t)\n\n    Notice that the acceleration is always proportional to the displacement and in the opposite direction, which is a defining characteristic of SHM.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    Based on the given information (A = 0.05 m, T = 2 s), we've determined the frequency (\u03bd = 0.5 Hz) and angular frequency (\u03c9 = \u03c0 rad/s). The displacement of the object undergoing SHM can be described by a general sinusoidal equation, x(t) = A cos(\u03c9t + \u03c6) or  x(t) = A sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6).  To find the specific equation, you need to determine the initial conditions from the student's graph and calculate the phase constant, \u03c6. The velocity and acceleration can then be found by taking the first and second derivatives of the displacement function, respectively.\n",
        "model_answer": "### Summary ###\nPoints to ponder\n\n### Definitions ###\nOkay, here's a breakdown of Chapter 13, \"Oscillations,\" designed to help someone understand the core concepts:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis chapter introduces oscillatory motion, a type of periodic motion where an object moves back and forth around an equilibrium position. It covers key concepts like period, frequency, displacement, and amplitude. The chapter focuses on simple harmonic motion (SHM), a special case where the restoring force is proportional to the displacement. It explores the relationship between SHM and uniform circular motion, derives equations for velocity and acceleration in SHM, and discusses the energy (kinetic and potential) of a system undergoing SHM. Finally, it examines the simple pendulum as an example of SHM under certain conditions.\n\n**Definitions:**\n\n*   **Periodic Motion:** Any motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time. Think of a planet orbiting a star; it returns to the same position after a fixed amount of time.\n\n*   **Oscillatory Motion:** A type of periodic motion where an object moves back and forth around a central or equilibrium position. A swing set or a bouncing ball are good examples.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Position:** The point where an object experiences no net force, and if left at rest, will remain at rest. For a pendulum, this is the hanging straight down position.\n\n*   **Displacement:** A measure of how far an object is from its equilibrium position at any given time. It can be positive or negative depending on the direction.\n\n*   **Amplitude (A):** The maximum displacement of an oscillating object from its equilibrium position. It represents the \"height\" of the oscillation.\n\n*   **Period (T):** The time it takes for one complete cycle of oscillation. It's measured in seconds.\n\n*   **Frequency (\u03bd):** The number of oscillations that occur per unit of time (usually one second). It's measured in Hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second. Frequency and period are inversely related:  \u03bd = 1/T\n\n*   **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM):** A specific type of oscillatory motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the opposite direction. This results in a sinusoidal (sine or cosine) pattern of motion. A mass on a spring is a classic example.\n\n*   **Phase (\u03c9t + \u03c6):** Describes the state of the oscillating object at a particular time. It includes both the angular frequency (\u03c9) and the initial phase constant (\u03c6).\n\n*   **Phase Constant (\u03c6):** Represents the initial phase of the oscillation at time t=0. It determines the starting position of the object.\n\n*   **Angular Frequency (\u03c9):** A measure of how quickly the oscillations occur, expressed in radians per second. It's related to the frequency (\u03bd) and period (T) by: \u03c9 = 2\u03c0\u03bd = 2\u03c0/T\n\n*   **Restoring Force:** The force that acts to bring an oscillating object back towards its equilibrium position. In SHM, this force is proportional to the displacement.\n\n**Solved Example:**\n\n*Problem:*\n\nA 0.5 kg block is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 80 N/m. The block is initially at rest at its equilibrium position. An external force is applied, stretching the spring by 0.1 meters. The block is then released and oscillates horizontally.\n(a) What is the angular frequency of the oscillation?\n(b) What is the maximum speed of the block?\n(c) What is the total energy of the oscillating system?\n(d) If the initial phase is 0, what is the equation of motion of the block?\n\n*Solution:*\n\n(a) *Angular Frequency:*\n\u03c9 = \u221a(k/m) = \u221a(80 N/m / 0.5 kg) = \u221a160 rad/s = 12.65 rad/s\n\n(b) *Maximum Speed:*\nThe maximum speed occurs when the block passes through the equilibrium position. At this point, all the potential energy stored in the spring is converted to kinetic energy.\nMaximum displacement (Amplitude)= 0.1 m\nv_max = A\u03c9=0.1*12.65 m/s = 1.265 m/s\n\n(c) *Total Energy:*\nThe total energy of the system is equal to the potential energy stored in the spring at maximum displacement.\nE = (1/2)kA^2 = (1/2) * 80 N/m * (0.1 m)^2 = 0.4 J\n\n(d) *Equation of Motion:*\nSince the block starts at its maximum displacement (0.1 m) and the initial phase is zero, we use a cosine function:\nx(t) = A cos(\u03c9t) = 0.1 cos(12.65t) meters\n\n### Solved Examples ###\nOn an average, a human\nWhich of the following\nof a periodic motion.
