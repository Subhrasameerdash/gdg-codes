        "student_answer": "1.  **Conceptual Understanding & Application:** A line segment AB in 3D space has its endpoints A on the XY-plane and B on the YZ-plane.  If the coordinates of the midpoint of AB are (2, -1, 3), determine the possible ranges of x, y, and z coordinates for points A and B. Explain your reasoning based on the properties of the coordinate planes.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the given assignment question:\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem describes a line segment AB in 3D space. Point A lies on the XY-plane, meaning its z-coordinate is 0. Point B lies on the YZ-plane, meaning its x-coordinate is 0. We are given the midpoint of AB and need to deduce information about the possible coordinates of A and B.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n*   **XY-plane:** Defined by z = 0. Any point on this plane has coordinates (x, y, 0).\n*   **YZ-plane:** Defined by x = 0. Any point on this plane has coordinates (0, y, z).\n*   **Midpoint Formula:**  The coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment joining points (x\u2081, y\u2081, z\u2081) and (x\u2082, y\u2082, z\u2082) are  ((x\u2081 + x\u2082)/2, (y\u2081 + y\u2082)/2, (z\u2081 + z\u2082)/2).\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet the coordinates of point A be (x\u2081, y\u2081, 0) and the coordinates of point B be (0, y\u2082, z\u2082).  We are given that the midpoint of AB is (2, -1, 3). Using the midpoint formula:\n\n((x\u2081 + 0)/2, (y\u2081 + y\u2082)/2, (0 + z\u2082)/2) = (2, -1, 3)\n\nThis gives us three equations:\n\n1.  x\u2081/2 = 2  =>  x\u2081 = 4\n2.  (y\u2081 + y\u2082)/2 = -1 => y\u2081 + y\u2082 = -2\n3.  z\u2082/2 = 3  => z\u2082 = 6\n\n**Determining the Ranges:**\n\n*   **x-coordinate:**\n    *   Since x\u2081 = 4, the x-coordinate of point A is fixed at 4.  Therefore, the range of x for point A is simply x = 4.\n    *   The x-coordinate of point B is fixed at 0 (because it lies on the YZ-plane). Therefore, the range of x for point B is x = 0.\n\n*   **y-coordinate:**\n    *   We know that y\u2081 + y\u2082 = -2.  This means that y\u2081 = -2 - y\u2082.\n    *   There are no explicit restrictions on the values of y\u2081 and y\u2082.  They can be any real numbers as long as their sum is -2.\n    *   Therefore, the range of y for both point A and point B is all real numbers, subject to the condition that  y\u2081 + y\u2082 = -2. We can express this by saying:  y for point A can be any real number, and y for point B is -2 minus the y-coordinate of Point A.\n\n*   **z-coordinate:**\n    *   The z-coordinate of point A is fixed at 0 (because it lies on the XY-plane). Therefore, the range of z for point A is simply z = 0.\n    *   Since z\u2082 = 6, the z-coordinate of point B is fixed at 6. Therefore, the range of z for point B is z = 6.\n\n**Summary of Ranges:**\n\n*   **Point A (x, y, z):**\n    *   x = 4\n    *   y: All real numbers.\n    *   z = 0\n*   **Point B (x, y, z):**\n    *   x = 0\n    *   y: All real numbers, where y = -2 - (y-coordinate of Point A)\n    *   z = 6\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe x and z coordinates of points A and B are fixed due to the constraints of lying on the XY and YZ planes, respectively, and the given midpoint. The y-coordinates can take on any real values, as long as their sum equals -2. This demonstrates how the properties of coordinate planes and the midpoint formula can be used to deduce information about the possible locations of points in 3D space.\n\n2.  **Problem Solving & Spatial Reasoning:** Imagine a cube with side length 'a' units, positioned such that one vertex coincides with the origin (0, 0, 0) and three edges extend along the positive x, y, and z axes. Determine the coordinates of all eight vertices of the cube. Then, calculate the distance between the vertex at the origin and the vertex farthest from the origin.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a solution to the cube problem, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have a cube placed in the 3D coordinate system. One corner is at the origin (0,0,0), and the cube's edges align with the positive x, y, and z axes. We need to find the coordinates of all the corners (vertices) and the distance between the origin and the opposite corner.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Identifying the Vertices:**\n\n    Since the cube has a side length of 'a' and is aligned with the axes, we can systematically determine the coordinates of each vertex:\n\n    *   **Origin:** (0, 0, 0)\n    *   **Along x-axis:** (a, 0, 0)\n    *   **Along y-axis:** (0, a, 0)\n    *   **Along z-axis:** (0, 0, a)\n    *   **In the xy-plane:** (a, a, 0)\n    *   **In the xz-plane:** (a, 0, a)\n    *   **In the yz-plane:** (0, a, a)\n    *   **Farthest from the origin:** (a, a, a)\n\n2.  **Calculating the Distance:**\n\n    We need to find the distance between the origin (0, 0, 0) and the vertex farthest from it, which is (a, a, a). We use the distance formula:\n\n    Distance = \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2 + (z\u2082 - z\u2081)\u00b2]\n\n    Substituting the coordinates:\n\n    Distance = \u221a[(a - 0)\u00b2 + (a - 0)\u00b2 + (a - 0)\u00b2]\n    Distance = \u221a(a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + a\u00b2)\n    Distance = \u221a(3a\u00b2)\n    Distance = a\u221a3\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe coordinates of the eight vertices of the cube are:\n\n*   (0, 0, 0)\n*   (a, 0, 0)\n*   (0, a, 0)\n*   (0, 0, a)\n*   (a, a, 0)\n*   (a, 0, a)\n*   (0, a, a)\n*   (a, a, a)\n\nThe distance between the origin and the vertex farthest from the origin is **a\u221a3 units**.\n\n3.  **Analytical & Proof-Based Question:** The points A(x,y,z), B(1,2,3) and C(-1,-2,-1) are collinear. Show that the ratio in which B divides AC is constant, irrespective of the value of x,y, and z. Find this ratio.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a solution to the problem, suitable for a Class 11-12 student:\n\n**Understanding Collinearity and Section Formula**\n\nFirst, let's remember what it means for points to be collinear: they lie on the same straight line.  If B divides AC in some ratio, we can use the section formula to express the coordinates of B in terms of the coordinates of A and C, and the ratio. Our goal is to show that this ratio is constant, meaning it doesn't depend on the specific location of point A (represented by the variables x, y, and z).\n\n**Applying the Section Formula**\n\nLet's assume that B divides AC in the ratio *k:1*.  This means that for every *k* units of distance from A to B, there is 1 unit of distance from B to C. Using the section formula for 3D coordinates:\n\nCoordinates of B =  [ (k * Coordinates of C + 1 * Coordinates of A) / (k + 1) ]\n\nApplying this to each coordinate:\n\n*   x-coordinate of B:  1 = (k * (-1) + 1 * x) / (k + 1)\n*   y-coordinate of B:  2 = (k * (-2) + 1 * y) / (k + 1)\n*   z-coordinate of B:  3 = (k * (-1) + 1 * z) / (k + 1)\n\n**Solving for *k***\n\nNow, let's solve each equation for *k*:\n\n*   From the x-coordinate equation:\n    1 = (-k + x) / (k + 1)\n    k + 1 = -k + x\n    2k = x - 1\n    k = (x - 1) / 2\n\n*   From the y-coordinate equation:\n    2 = (-2k + y) / (k + 1)\n    2k + 2 = -2k + y\n    4k = y - 2\n    k = (y - 2) / 4\n\n*   From the z-coordinate equation:\n    3 = (-k + z) / (k + 1)\n    3k + 3 = -k + z\n    4k = z - 3\n    k = (z - 3) / 4\n\n**Establishing the Constant Ratio**\n\nSince all three equations must hold true simultaneously for the same value of *k*, we can equate any two of them to eliminate *k* and see what relationship exists between x, y, and z. However, notice something crucial: *we don't need to!*\n\nBecause A, B, and C are collinear, there can only be one valid k that defines their relative position.\n\nInstead, observe that :\nk = (y - 2) / 4\n2k = (y-2)/2\nSolving for y;\n2k = (y-2)/2\n4k = y-2\ny = 4k + 2\n\nSimilarly:\nk = (z - 3) / 4\n4k = z-3\nz = 4k+3\n\nWe can substitute these into the x equation to solve for k.\n\nk = (x-1)/2\n2k = x-1\nx = 2k+1\n\nThis shows that regardless of the value of x,y, or z, the ratio k is constant.\n\nTo Find it:\n\nWe have B(1,2,3)\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3\n\nSubstitute any of these into the formulas for k above.\nFor example:\nk = (x-1)/2 = (1-1)/2 = 0\n\n*Important Caveat*\nWhen k = 0, this means that B and A are the same point.\n\nHowever, it is also equally valid to approach this from the other direction and compare to C to see what the value should be.\n\nAC/CB = k\nSo CB/AC = 1/k\n\nThus, CB =  [ (k * Coordinates of A + 1 * Coordinates of C) / (k + 1) ]\n\nCoordinates of B =  [ (k * (x,y,z) + 1 * (-1,-2,-1) ) / (k + 1) ]\nx-coordinate of B:  1 = (k * (x) + 1 * (-1) ) / (k + 1)\ny-coordinate of B:  2 = (k * (y) + 1 * (-2)) / (k + 1)\nz-coordinate of B:  3 = (k * (z) + 1 * (-1) ) / (k + 1)\n\n*   From the x-coordinate equation:\n    1 = (kx - 1) / (k + 1)\n    k + 1 = kx -1\n    2 = kx-k\n    2 = k(x-1)\n    k = 2/(x-1)\n\n*   From the y-coordinate equation:\n    2 = (ky - 2) / (k + 1)\n    2k + 2 = ky -2\n    4 = ky-2k\n    4 = k(y-2)\n    k = 4/(y-2)\n\n*   From the z-coordinate equation:\n    3 = (kz - 1) / (k + 1)\n    3k + 3 = kz - 1\n    4 + 3k = kz\n    4 = kz-3k\n    4 = k(z-3)\n    k = 4/(z-3)\n\nSince k is constant, it means that  2/(x-1) = 4/(y-2) =  4/(z-3)\n\nFrom the previous equations above we stated:\nx = 2k+1\ny = 4k+2\nz = 4k+3\n\nSubstituting these new equations to confirm will produce the same ratios.\nk = 2/(x-1)\nk = 2/(2k+1 -1)\nk = 2/2k\nk^2 = 1\nk = 1\n\nTherefore the final answer is:\n\nThe ratio in which B divides AC is constant, irrespective of the value of x,y, and z, and that ratio is 1. B is thus the midpoint of A and C.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n*   The section formula is crucial for solving this type of problem.\n*   The concept of collinearity implies a consistent relationship between the coordinates of the points.\n*   While solving for *k*, be mindful of potential divisions by zero (which would imply that A and B, or B and C, coincide).\n*   Express the final answer in a clear and concise manner.\n",

        "feedback": "**\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Question 1:** Mostly Accurate. The student correctly identifies the core concepts and applies the midpoint formula effectively. The determination of the x and z coordinates being fixed is accurate. The discussion on the y-coordinate is also technically correct that the y-coordinate can be any real number as long as their sum is -2, though it could be stated more concisely.\n*   **Question 2:** Highly Accurate. The student correctly identifies all the vertices and applies the distance formula correctly. The final distance calculation is accurate.\n*   **Question 3:** Partially Accurate. The student initially makes good progress setting up the problem using the section formula and solving for *k*. The student makes a mistake by assuming that the \"all three equations must hold true simultaneously for the same value of k\" needs to be used to eliminate *k*. Instead, the student should be focusing on plugging in and utilizing the equations in the correct ratio. There is a *Major Caveat* that the student identifies (when k=0, B and A are the same point), however the logic to calculate the ratio is correctly displayed further down the text. The ratio answer is correct, however the path to reaching the answer is obfuscated. The student recognizes that the ratio in which B divides AC is constant (k=1). B is thus the midpoint of A and C.\n\n**2. Clarity:**\n\n*   **Question 1:** Clear and easy to understand. The explanation is well-structured and uses clear language. The bullet-point summary is helpful.\n*   **Question 2:** Very Clear. Excellent structure and easy-to-follow steps. The labeling of vertices and the separate calculation of the distance contribute to the clarity.\n*   **Question 3:** Clarity is lacking. The long-winded approach to establishing a constant ratio and the multiple sets of formulas for \"k\" make the final answer obfuscated.\n\n**3. Structure:**\n\n*   **Question 1:** Well-Structured. The answer is organized into sections: Understanding the Problem, Key Concepts, Solution, Determining the Ranges, and Summary of Ranges. Each section flows logically into the next.\n*   **Question 2:** Excellent Structure. The problem is clearly defined, the steps are logically presented, and the answer is clearly stated.\n*   **Question 3:** Poorly Structured. The logic is obscured and can be hard to follow for students. The double approach that results in multiple sets of k formulas adds confusion.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Conciseness (Question 1):** While the student's explanation is correct, they can strive to be more concise. For example, instead of stating \"y for point A can be any real number, and y for point B is -2 minus the y-coordinate of Point A,\" they could say, \"y\u2081 + y\u2082 = -2, where y\u2081 and y\u2082 can be any real numbers satisfying this equation.\"\n*   **Focus and Proof (Question 3):** The most significant area for improvement is in the analytical proof. The student meanders instead of focusing on directly demonstrating the ratio and making it clear for a high school student.\n*   **Show Work Clearly (Question 3):** The formatting can be improved to better separate the solution from the understanding section.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a good understanding of the core concepts.\n*   **Application:** The student correctly applies the midpoint and distance formulas.\n*   **Organization:** The student attempts to organize their answers logically.\n*   **Completeness:** The student provides complete answers.\n\nIn conclusion, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts and can apply the formulas correctly. However, the student should work on conciseness in explanations and focus on directness and clarity in analytical proofs."
