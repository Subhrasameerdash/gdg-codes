        "student_answer": "1.  A coordination compound with the formula CoCl3.5NH3 exists as two isomers, A and B. Isomer A reacts with AgNO3 to produce 2 moles of AgCl per mole of the compound, while isomer B does not react with AgNO3. Determine the structural formulas of isomers A and B, providing IUPAC names for each. Explain the difference in their reactivity with AgNO3 based on the nature of the chloride ions in the complex.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the provided question about coordination isomers and their reactivity:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet's analyze the coordination compound CoCl3.5NH3 and its isomers A and B, considering their differing reactions with AgNO3.\n\n**1. Determining the Structural Formulas:**\n\n*   **Isomer A:** Reacts with AgNO3 to produce 2 moles of AgCl per mole of the compound. This indicates that two chloride ions are *outside* the coordination sphere as counter ions, and can precipitate with silver ions. This means that one Cl- is inside the coordination sphere. Given that there are 5 NH3 ligands, and 1 Cl- inside the coordination sphere, the coordination number of Co is 6, and the formula can be written as [CoCl(NH3)5]Cl2.\n\n*   **Isomer B:** Does *not* react with AgNO3. This implies that all three chloride ions are *inside* the coordination sphere, and therefore not free to react with silver ions to form AgCl precipitate. Since the total number of ligands in the complex is 5 NH3 and 3 Cl-, the number of ligands are 8 which can not be correct since the coordination number can not exceed 6. Therefore, the question must have made a typo and the number of ligands must be 5 instead of 6. The formula for Isomer B is [CoCl3(NH3)3].\n\n**2. IUPAC Names:**\n\n*   **Isomer A ([CoCl(NH3)5]Cl2):** Pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) chloride\n\n*   **Isomer B ([CoCl3(NH3)3]):** Triamminetrichloridocobalt(III)\n\n**3. Explanation of Reactivity Difference with AgNO3:**\n\nThe difference in reactivity arises from the location of the chloride ions relative to the coordination sphere:\n\n*   **Isomer A:** In [CoCl(NH3)5]Cl2, the two chloride ions outside the square brackets are *counter ions*. When this compound is dissolved in water, these chloride ions dissociate and are free in solution. When AgNO3 is added, these free chloride ions react with silver ions (Ag+) to form insoluble silver chloride (AgCl) precipitate:\n\n    2Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq) + 2AgNO3(aq) \u2192 2AgCl(s) + 2NO3<sup>-</sup>(aq)\n\n    The chloride ion *inside* the coordination sphere (directly bonded to the cobalt ion) is tightly bound and does *not* participate in this precipitation reaction.\n\n*   **Isomer B:** In [CoCl3(NH3)3], all three chloride ions are ligands directly coordinated (bonded) to the cobalt(III) ion within the coordination sphere. These chloride ions are not free in solution and are not available to react with silver ions. Therefore, no AgCl precipitate forms when AgNO3 is added. These chloride ions are covalently bonded to the Cobalt ion and are tightly held within the coordination complex.\n\n2.  Consider two complexes: [Fe(CN)6]4- and [Fe(H2O)6]2+. Explain why one is considered a homoleptic complex and the other a heteroleptic complex. Determine and compare the oxidation state of iron in each complex. Further, based on ligand properties, predict which complex will exhibit a higher crystal field splitting energy (\u0394o) and justify your reasoning.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet's analyze the two complexes, \\[Fe(CN)6]4- and \\[Fe(H2O)6]2+, step-by-step:\n\n**1. Homoleptic vs. Heteroleptic:**\n\n*   **\\[Fe(CN)6]4-:** This complex is considered **homoleptic** because the iron(II) ion is coordinated *only* to cyanide (CN-) ligands. There is only *one* type of ligand bound to the central metal.\n*   **\\[Fe(H2O)6]2+:** This complex is also considered **homoleptic** because the iron(II) ion is coordinated *only* to water (H2O) ligands. There is only *one* type of ligand bound to the central metal.\n\n**2. Oxidation State of Iron:**\n\nTo determine the oxidation state of iron in each complex, we'll use the following equation:\n\nOxidation State of Metal + (Total Charge of Ligands) = Overall Charge of Complex\n\n*   **\\[Fe(CN)6]4-:**\n    *   Let the oxidation state of Fe be 'x'.\n    *   The charge of each CN- ligand is -1.  There are 6 CN- ligands, so the total charge from the ligands is -6.\n    *   The overall charge of the complex is -4.\n    *   Therefore, x + (-6) = -4  =>  x = +2\n    *   The oxidation state of iron in \\[Fe(CN)6]4- is +2.\n\n*   **\\[Fe(H2O)6]2+:**\n    *   Let the oxidation state of Fe be 'x'.\n    *   Water (H2O) is a neutral ligand, so its charge is 0. The total charge from the ligands is 0.\n    *   The overall charge of the complex is +2.\n    *   Therefore, x + (0) = +2  =>  x = +2\n    *   The oxidation state of iron in \\[Fe(H2O)6]2+ is +2.\n\nTherefore, the oxidation state of iron is **+2** in both complexes.\n\n**3. Crystal Field Splitting Energy (\u0394o):**\n\nCrystal Field Splitting Energy (\u0394o) depends on the nature of the ligands. Ligands are arranged in a spectrochemical series based on their ability to cause splitting of the d-orbitals.  Strong field ligands cause a larger splitting (higher \u0394o), while weak field ligands cause a smaller splitting (lower \u0394o).\n\nIn the spectrochemical series, cyanide (CN-) is a strong field ligand, while water (H2O) is a weak field ligand.\n\n*   **Prediction:** \\[Fe(CN)6]4- will exhibit a higher crystal field splitting energy (\u0394o) compared to \\[Fe(H2O)6]2+.\n\n*   **Justification:** CN- is a stronger field ligand than H2O. Stronger field ligands interact more strongly with the metal d-orbitals, leading to a greater energy difference between the eg and t2g sets of d-orbitals. This increased energy difference *is* the crystal field splitting energy (\u0394o). Thus, the complex with CN- ligands will have a larger \u0394o value.\n\n3.  A student performs an experiment with a coordination compound and observes the following: The compound has the empirical formula PtCl2.2NH3. The compound does not have any geometrical isomers. Draw the structure of the compound. What is the coordination number of platinum in this complex? What is the shape of this complex?\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer appropriate for a CBSE Class 11-12 student tackling that coordination compound problem:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo determine the structure of the coordination compound PtCl2.2NH3, we need to consider the information provided: the empirical formula and the absence of geometrical isomers.\n\n1. **Determining the Coordination Sphere:** Since platinum (Pt) is a transition metal, it's likely to form a coordination complex.  All the components of the empirical formula (PtCl2.2NH3) must be within the coordination sphere, thus the molecule is \\[PtCl2(NH3)2].\n\n2. **Possible Geometries and Isomerism:** Platinum(II) complexes commonly exhibit square planar or tetrahedral geometries. Let's consider both:\n\n    *   **Tetrahedral:** If the complex were tetrahedral, there would be only one possible arrangement of the ligands. All the ligands are equidistant from each other, and since the ligands can occupy any spot in the tetrahedral structure, the structure would be the same regardless of the permutation of the position of the ligands.\n\n    *   **Square Planar:** If the complex were square planar, two geometrical isomers would be possible:\n        *   *cis*-\\[PtCl2(NH3)2]: The two chloride ligands (Cl) are adjacent to each other, and the two ammonia ligands (NH3) are adjacent to each other.\n        *   *trans*-\\[PtCl2(NH3)2]: The two chloride ligands (Cl) are opposite each other, and the two ammonia ligands (NH3) are opposite each other.\n\n3. **Applying the Given Information:** The problem states that the compound *does not* have any geometrical isomers. This rules out the possibility of a square planar complex with *cis* and *trans* isomers. Therefore, for the compound to only have one form, it must be tetrahedral.\n\n4.  **Drawing the Structure:**\n(Since I cannot draw here, imagine Pt at the center of a tetrahedron, with two NH3 and two Cl ligands at the corners.)\n\n5.  **Coordination Number:** The coordination number of platinum in this complex is 4 because there are four ligands (2 Cl- and 2 NH3) directly bonded to the central platinum atom/ion.\n\n6.  **Shape of the Complex:** Based on our reasoning, the shape of the complex \\[PtCl2(NH3)2] is tetrahedral.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **Structure:** The complex is \\[PtCl2(NH3)2] and the shape is tetrahedral.\n*   **Coordination Number:** 4\n*   **Shape:** Tetrahedral.\n",
        "model_answer": "### Summary ###\nSummary\n\n### Definitions ###\nOkay, here's a breakdown of coordination compounds designed to help explain the core concepts:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis section introduces coordination compounds, a vital area of inorganic chemistry. These compounds, formed when metal atoms/ions bind to molecules or ions (ligands) through coordinate bonds, play critical roles in biological systems (like chlorophyll and hemoglobin), industrial processes, and medicine.  The section explores Werner's theory, basic definitions (ligands, coordination number, etc.), nomenclature, isomerism, and bonding theories like Valence Bond Theory (VBT) and Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to explain their structure, properties, and applications.\n\n**Definitions of Key Terms:**\n\n*   **Coordination Compound:** A compound containing a central metal atom or ion bonded to a surrounding array of molecules or ions called ligands.\n\n*   **Central Atom/Ion:**  The metal atom or ion at the center of a coordination compound, acting as a Lewis acid (electron-pair acceptor).\n\n*   **Ligand:** An ion or molecule that binds to the central metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. Ligands act as Lewis bases (electron-pair donors). Examples are Cl-, NH3, or even larger molecules.\n\n*   **Coordination Number:** The number of ligand donor atoms directly bonded to the central metal atom/ion. It indicates how many bonds are formed to the central metal.\n\n*   **Coordination Sphere:** The central metal atom/ion and its directly attached ligands, enclosed in square brackets in the compound's formula.  It represents the core complex.\n\n*   **Coordination Polyhedron:** The geometric shape formed by the arrangement of ligands around the central metal atom/ion (e.g., octahedral, tetrahedral, square planar).\n\n*   **Oxidation Number:** The charge the central metal atom would have if all ligands were removed along with the electron pairs shared with it.\n\n*   **Homoleptic Complex:** A complex where the metal is bound to only *one* type of ligand (e.g., \\[Fe(CN)6]4-).\n\n*   **Heteroleptic Complex:** A complex where the metal is bound to *more than one* type of ligand (e.g., \\[Co(NH3)4Cl2]+).\n\n*   **Isomers:** Compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms, leading to distinct properties. Coordination compounds exhibit structural and stereoisomerism.\n\n**Solved Example Problem:**\n\n**Problem:** A coordination compound has the formula CrCl3 \u00b7 6H2O. Conductivity measurements show that one mole of this compound produces two moles of ions in solution. When treated with excess silver nitrate (AgNO3), one mole of the compound yields one mole of silver chloride (AgCl) precipitate. Deduce the formula of the coordination compound, provide its IUPAC name, and explain the observations.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Determine the Counter Ion:** Since one mole of the compound yields one mole of AgCl, this means that one chloride ion is outside the coordination sphere as a counter ion.\n2. **Determine the coordination number and the coordination sphere**: It is given that one mole of the compound produces two moles of ions in solution. Since one chloride ions is the counter ion, the rest of the compound including the metal must form a complex that carries one charge. That means the metal and the ligands form the coordination sphere. Given that the water molecule is neutral, the 3 chlorides, one is the counter ion, the other two must be ligands to satisfy the need for the coordination sphere to have one charge. We know that chromium can have coordinate number of 6, so the coordination number must be 6 and the ligands must be the two chloride molecules and the 4 water molecules.\n3.  **Write the Coordination Compound Formula:** Based on the above steps, the formula of the coordination compound is \\[CrCl2(H2O)4]Cl \u00b7 2H2O. Note that the two water molecules that is not included in the coordination sphere, is outside the bracket.\n4.  **IUPAC Name:** The IUPAC name of the compound is tetraaquadichloridochromium(III) chloride dihydrate.\n5.  **Explanation:** In solution, the coordination compound ionizes as follows:\n\n    \\[CrCl2(H2O)4]Cl(s) -> \\[CrCl2(H2O)4]+(aq) + Cl-(aq).\n\n    The chloride ion outside the coordination sphere reacts with silver nitrate to form AgCl precipitate:\n\n    Cl-(aq) + AgNO3(aq) -> AgCl(s) + NO3-(aq)\n\n    The chloride ions within the coordination sphere are tightly bound to the chromium(III) ion and do not react with silver nitrate under these conditions. This explains the 1:1 mole ratio of compound to AgCl.\n\n### Solved Examples ###\nExample 5.1\nExample 5.1\nWerner\nExample 5.2\nExample 5.2\nSolution\nExample 5.3\nExample 5.3\nSolution\nExample 5.4\nExample 5.4\nReprint 2024-25\nis provided by complexes\nis provided by [Co(NH3)6][Cr(CN)6], in which the NH3 ligands\nis provided by the ionisation\nExample 5.5\nExample 5.5\nSolution\nExample 5.6\nExample 5.6\nReprint 2024-25\nis provided by the aqua\nis [Ni(CN)4]\n2\u2013.

        "feedback": "No feedback provided.\nOkay, here's a breakdown of the student's answer, compared to the model answer, along with a grade and constructive feedback:\n\n\n\n**Detailed Evaluation:**\n\n**1. Accuracy (25/30):**\n\n*   **Question 1:** The student correctly identifies the coordination spheres for Isomers A and B.  They accurately deduce the number of chloride ions inside and outside the coordination sphere based on the AgCl precipitation data. The student identifies that there is a typo with the number of ligands, which is a major win. This suggests they have a good grasp of the concepts and are willing to challenge the question itself. However, they incorrectly state that Isomer B has the formula \\[CoCl3(NH3)3]. Given that the total number of ligands should be 5 instead of 6, the formula should be \\[CoCl3(NH3)2].\n*   **Question 2:** The student accurately determines the oxidation state of iron in both complexes and correctly identifies the difference in crystal field splitting energy (\u0394o) based on the spectrochemical series. The student identifies both complexes are homoleptic, which is the correct answer.\n*   **Question 3:** This is where the answer significantly falters. The student correctly identifies the coordination sphere and considers both tetrahedral and square planar geometries. However, they incorrectly conclude that the absence of geometrical isomers implies a tetrahedral geometry. Platinum(II) complexes with four ligands are *overwhelmingly* square planar. The *trans* isomer, not having a dipole, would not react. So there is indeed only 1 product. Therefore, the tetrahedral structure is incorrect.\n\n**2. Clarity (28/35):**\n\n*   The student's explanations are generally clear and well-written. They break down each problem into smaller, logical steps, making the reasoning easier to follow. The use of bullet points enhances clarity.\n*   The explanations for the reactivity differences with AgNO3 are well-articulated and demonstrate a solid understanding of the underlying chemistry.\n*   The explanation regarding the spectrochemical series and its influence on crystal field splitting energy is also clear and concise.\n*   The reasoning for choosing the tetrahedral shape in Question 3 is flawed, the writing itself is clear in presenting that (incorrect) reasoning.\n\n**3. Structure (25/35):**\n\n*   The answers are well-organized and follow a logical flow. Each question is addressed systematically, with clear headings and subheadings.\n*   The step-by-step approach to calculating the oxidation state and predicting crystal field splitting energy is well-structured and easy to follow.\n*   The use of bullet points and numbered lists enhances the overall organization and readability of the answers.\n*   The overall structure of each answer is excellent; however, the incorrect conclusion in Question 3 detracts from the overall quality.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   Strong understanding of coordination compound principles, especially regarding isomerism, reactivity, and oxidation states.\n*   Clear and well-organized explanations.\n*   Ability to apply concepts to solve problems.\n*   Willingness to challenge the premise of the question.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Question 1:** It is important to get the formula correct to get the question correct.\n*   **Question 3:** Needs to revisit the common geometries of transition metal complexes, especially Platinum(II). Square planar is the standard geometry for Pt(II) with four ligands.\n*   Pay closer attention to the specific properties of transition metals and their preferred geometries.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   Reinforce the geometries of common transition metal complexes (especially square planar).\n*   Practice more problems involving the determination of structural formulas and IUPAC nomenclature.\n*   Double-check the empirical formula to ensure they are all accounted for."
