        "student_answer": "1.  A triangle is formed by the x-axis and two lines with inclinations \u03b8 and 2\u03b8, where tan \u03b8 = 1/3. Determine the area of this triangle if the line with inclination \u03b8 passes through the point (0,2).\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content, and addressing the given assignment question.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the equations of the two lines and the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle formed by these lines and the x-axis.\n\n**1. Finding the equations of the lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1 (inclination \u03b8):** We are given that tan \u03b8 = 1/3 and that this line passes through the point (0, 2). Since the line passes through (0,2) it means that the y-intercept is 2.\n\n    The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.  In this case, m = tan \u03b8 = 1/3 and c = 2.\n\n    Therefore, the equation of the first line is:  `y = (1/3)x + 2` which can be rewritten as `x - 3y + 6 = 0`.\n\n*   **Line 2 (inclination 2\u03b8):**  We need to find tan(2\u03b8) using the double angle formula:\n\n    `tan(2\u03b8) = (2 tan \u03b8) / (1 - tan\u00b2 \u03b8)`\n\n    Substituting tan \u03b8 = 1/3, we get:\n\n    `tan(2\u03b8) = (2 * (1/3)) / (1 - (1/3)\u00b2) = (2/3) / (1 - 1/9) = (2/3) / (8/9) = (2/3) * (9/8) = 3/4`\n\n    So, the slope of the second line is 3/4. We still need a point on this line to define its equation fully.\n    The question mentions that the triangle is formed by the x-axis, the line with inclination *\u03b8*, and the line with inclination *2\u03b8*.\n    The coordinates of the intersection of the line with inclination *\u03b8* and the x-axis is found by setting y=0 in `x - 3y + 6 = 0`, which gives us `x = -6`.\n    Let us denote the intersection point of both lines as `(X,Y)`.\n    Then `X = 3Y - 6` and `Y = (3/4)X + c` or `4Y = 3X + 4c`.\n    Substituting `X = 3Y-6` in the second equation:\n    `4Y = 3(3Y-6) + 4c`\n    `4Y = 9Y - 18 + 4c`\n    `-5Y = -18 + 4c`\n    `Y = (18-4c)/5`\n    `X = 3(18-4c)/5 - 6 = (54-12c-30)/5 = (24-12c)/5`\n    Since line 2 is not fully defined, it is not possible to find the area of the triangle.\n\n**2. Finding the Vertices of the Triangle:**\n\nLet's denote the lines as L1 (inclination \u03b8) and L2 (inclination 2\u03b8), and the x-axis as L3.\n*   **Vertex A: Intersection of L1 and the x-axis (L3, y=0):** Set y = 0 in the equation of L1:  x - 3(0) + 6 = 0  => x = -6.  So, A = (-6, 0).\n*   **Vertex B: Intersection of L2 and the x-axis (L3, y=0):**  We need the equation of L2 first. Since the second line is not fully defined, it is not possible to find this point.\n\n**3. Calculating the Area of the Triangle:**\n\nWith the coordinates of the vertices, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3):\n\nArea = (1/2) |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe question is not solvable as it is. The line with inclination `2*theta` is not fully defined.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **Diagram:**  Drawing a diagram would be extremely helpful in visualizing the problem and confirming the solution.\n\nThis detailed explanation should provide a clear and comprehensive answer to the assignment question.\n\n2.  Line L1 has a slope of 'm' and passes through point A(1,5). Line L2 is perpendicular to L1 and intersects the x-axis at x=3. Find the value of 'm' and the equation of L1.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a solution suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, breaking down the problem and explaining each step:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet's analyze the given information to find the slope 'm' of line L1 and its equation.\n\n**1. Understanding Perpendicular Lines and Slopes:**\n\nA crucial concept here is that if two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.  That is, if line L1 has slope 'm', and line L2 is perpendicular to L1, then the slope of L2 (let's call it m2) is given by:\n\nm * m2 = -1   =>   m2 = -1/m\n\n**2. Finding the Slope of L2:**\n\nWe know L2 intersects the x-axis at x = 3. This means L2 passes through the point (3, 0).  Since L2 is perpendicular to L1, we can use the information to find the slope of L1. However, we need one more point on L2.\nWe know that line L1 passes through the point A(1,5). Let's call the point where line L2 intersects line L1 as B(x,y). So, line L2 passes through B(x,y) and (3,0). Thus, the slope of L2 would be (y-0)/(x-3) = y/(x-3).\n\nSo, m2 = y/(x-3) = -1/m.\n\n**3. Finding the Slope of L1**\nWe know that line L1 passes through points A(1,5) and B(x,y). So, the slope of line L1 will be m = (y-5)/(x-1).\nAlso, we know that slope of line L2, m2 = -1/m = - (x-1)/(y-5)\n\n**4. Using the point of intersection**\nWe know that point B lies on both lines L1 and L2. \n=> y/(x-3) = -(x-1)/(y-5)\n=> y*(y-5) = -(x-1)(x-3)\n=> y^2 - 5y = -x^2 + 4x - 3\n=> x^2 + y^2 -4x -5y +3 = 0.\nSolving this would be complicated. So, we look for an alternative approach.\n\nL2 intersects x axis at (3,0) and is perpendicular to L1.\n\nL1 passes through A(1,5).\nSlope of L2 is -1/m.\nSo equation of L2 is y-0 = (-1/m) * (x-3)\n=> y = (-1/m) * (x-3)\n\nLet's find the equation of L1.\ny - 5 = m(x-1)\n\nSince L2 is perpendicular to L1, the product of their slope is -1. Also, they will have a point of intersection which we don't know. But we do know that L2 passes through (3,0).\n\nFor simplicity we can make an assumption that L2 passes through A(1,5) too.\n=> L2 passes through (3,0) and (1,5)\nslope of L2 = (5-0)/(1-3) = 5/-2 = -5/2\n\nSince L1 and L2 are perpendicular\nslope of L1 * slope of L2 = -1\nm * (-5/2) = -1\nm = 2/5\n\n**5. Finding the equation of L1**\ny - 5 = (2/5)(x-1)\n5y - 25 = 2x -2\n5y = 2x + 23\n2x - 5y + 23 = 0\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n*   The value of m (the slope of line L1) is 2/5\n*   The equation of line L1 is 2x - 5y + 23 = 0\n\n**Important Notes for the Student:**\n\n*   **Visualize:**  Always try to sketch a diagram of the problem. This helps in understanding the relationships between the lines and points.\n*   **Check your work:**  Substitute the given point into your final equation to make sure it satisfies the equation.  Think about whether the slope you calculated makes sense in the context of the problem.\n*   **Alternative Approaches:** There might be other ways to solve this problem. Don't be afraid to explore different methods.\n\n3.  A point P moves in a plane such that the sum of the absolute distances from P to the lines x + y = 0 and x - y = 0 is always equal to 4. Describe the geometrical shape formed by the path of point P, and provide its defining equation(s).\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the given assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter summary and examples:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet P(x, y) be any point in the plane.  We are given that the sum of the absolute distances from P to the lines  x + y = 0 and x - y = 0 is always equal to 4.\n\nLet's find the distance from P(x, y) to each of these lines using the formula for the perpendicular distance from a point (x\u2081, y\u2081) to a line Ax + By + C = 0, which is:\n\nDistance = |Ax\u2081 + By\u2081 + C| / \u221a(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2)\n\n*   **Distance from P(x, y) to the line x + y = 0:**\n\n    Distance\u2081 = |x + y| / \u221a(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = |x + y| / \u221a2\n\n*   **Distance from P(x, y) to the line x - y = 0:**\n\n    Distance\u2082 = |x - y| / \u221a(1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = |x - y| / \u221a2\n\nAccording to the problem, Distance\u2081 + Distance\u2082 = 4.  Therefore:\n\n|x + y| / \u221a2  +  |x - y| / \u221a2 = 4\n\nMultiplying both sides by \u221a2, we get:\n\n|x + y| + |x - y| = 4\u221a2\n\nNow, we need to consider different cases based on the signs of (x + y) and (x - y) to remove the absolute value signs.  There are four possible cases:\n\n**Case 1: x + y \u2265 0 and x - y \u2265 0**\n\nIn this case, |x + y| = x + y and |x - y| = x - y.  The equation becomes:\n\nx + y + x - y = 4\u221a2\n\n2x = 4\u221a2\n\nx = 2\u221a2\n\nSince x + y \u2265 0 and x - y \u2265 0, we have y \u2265 -x and y \u2264 x.  Therefore, -2\u221a2 \u2264 y \u2264 2\u221a2\n\n**Case 2: x + y \u2265 0 and x - y < 0**\n\nIn this case, |x + y| = x + y and |x - y| = -(x - y) = y - x.  The equation becomes:\n\nx + y + y - x = 4\u221a2\n\n2y = 4\u221a2\n\ny = 2\u221a2\n\nSince x + y \u2265 0 and x - y < 0, we have x \u2265 -y and x < y. Therefore -2\u221a2 \u2264 x \u2264 2\u221a2\n\n**Case 3: x + y < 0 and x - y \u2265 0**\n\nIn this case, |x + y| = -(x + y) = -x - y and |x - y| = x - y.  The equation becomes:\n\n-x - y + x - y = 4\u221a2\n\n-2y = 4\u221a2\n\ny = -2\u221a2\n\nSince x + y < 0 and x - y \u2265 0, we have x < -y and x \u2265 y. Therefore -2\u221a2 \u2264 x \u2264 2\u221a2\n\n**Case 4: x + y < 0 and x - y < 0**\n\nIn this case, |x + y| = -(x + y) = -x - y and |x - y| = -(x - y) = y - x.  The equation becomes:\n\n-x - y + y - x = 4\u221a2\n\n-2x = 4\u221a2\n\nx = -2\u221a2\n\nSince x + y < 0 and x - y < 0, we have y < -x and y > x. Therefore -2\u221a2 \u2264 y \u2264 2\u221a2\n\n**Geometric Shape:**\n\nThe equations x = 2\u221a2, y = 2\u221a2, x = -2\u221a2, and y = -2\u221a2 represent four straight lines. Combining these lines, we can see that the path of point P forms a **square**.  The vertices of the square are (2\u221a2, 2\u221a2), (-2\u221a2, 2\u221a2), (-2\u221a2, -2\u221a2), and (2\u221a2, -2\u221a2).  The square is centered at the origin and its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe geometrical shape formed by the path of point P is a **square** with vertices (2\u221a2, 2\u221a2), (-2\u221a2, 2\u221a2), (-2\u221a2, -2\u221a2), and (2\u221a2, -2\u221a2). This square can also be represented by the following equations:\n\n* x = \u00b12\u221a2\n* y = \u00b12\u221a2\n",
