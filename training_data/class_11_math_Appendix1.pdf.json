        "student_answer": "1.  A student claims that the binomial expansion of (4 + x)^(-1/2) is valid for all real values of *x*. Critically evaluate this claim, stating the necessary condition for the validity of such an expansion and determining the range of *x* for which the expansion holds true.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student, addressing the given question:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe student's claim that the binomial expansion of (4 + x)^(-1/2) is valid for all real values of *x* is incorrect. The binomial theorem for any index, which allows for negative or fractional exponents, has a crucial condition for its validity.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe generalized binomial theorem states that for any index *n* (which can be a real number) and |x| < 1:\n\n(1 + x)^n = 1 + nx + [n(n-1)/2!]x^2 + [n(n-1)(n-2)/3!]x^3 + ...\n\nThis expansion is an *infinite series*, and it converges (i.e., has a finite sum) *only* when |x| < 1.  If |x| \u2265 1, the series diverges and does not represent (1 + x)^n.\n\nNow, let's consider the given expression (4 + x)^(-1/2). To apply the binomial theorem, we need to manipulate it into the form (1 + something)^n. We can do this by factoring out the 4:\n\n(4 + x)^(-1/2) = [4(1 + x/4)]^(-1/2) = 4^(-1/2) * (1 + x/4)^(-1/2) = (1/2) * (1 + x/4)^(-1/2)\n\nNow we have the expression in the required form (1 + x/4)^(-1/2). Here, we can now consider the validity condition. The binomial expansion of (1 + x/4)^(-1/2) will be valid only if |x/4| < 1.\n\nTherefore, |x/4| < 1  implies  |x| < 4.\n\nThis means -4 < x < 4.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe binomial expansion of (4 + x)^(-1/2) is valid only for **-4 < x < 4**. The student's claim is false because the binomial theorem for a non-integer index has a restricted range of validity.  The expansion only holds true when the absolute value of x/4 is less than 1, which restricts the possible values of *x* to the interval between -4 and 4. Outside this interval, the series diverges and does not represent the function.\n\n2.  Consider two infinite geometric series, Series A and Series B. Series A has a first term of 10 and a common ratio of *x*. Series B has a first term of 5 and a common ratio of 2*x*. Determine the range of values for *x* for which both series converge to a finite sum. Further, if *x* = 0.2, find the difference between the sums to infinity of Series A and Series B.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student, addressing the given assignment question, drawing upon the provided NCERT content:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo determine the range of values for *x* for which both infinite geometric series, Series A and Series B, converge to a finite sum, we need to apply the condition for convergence:  |r| < 1, where 'r' is the common ratio.\n\n**For Series A:**\n\n*   First term (a) = 10\n*   Common ratio (r) = *x*\n*   Convergence condition: |*x*| < 1  =>  -1 < *x* < 1\n\n**For Series B:**\n\n*   First term (a) = 5\n*   Common ratio (r) = 2*x*\n*   Convergence condition: |2*x*| < 1  =>  -1 < 2*x* < 1  =>  -1/2 < *x* < 1/2\n\n**Determining the Common Range for Convergence:**\n\nFor both series to converge *simultaneously*, *x* must satisfy *both* convergence conditions.  We need to find the intersection of the intervals -1 < *x* < 1 and -1/2 < *x* < 1/2. The more restrictive condition is -1/2 < *x* < 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the range of values for *x* for which both series converge to a finite sum is **-1/2 < *x* < 1/2**.\n\n**Calculating the Difference of Sums when x = 0.2:**\n\nSince 0.2 lies within the range -1/2 < *x* < 1/2, both series converge when *x* = 0.2.\n\n*   **Sum to infinity of Series A (S<sub>A</sub>):**\n\n    *   a = 10, r = 0.2\n    *   S<sub>A</sub> = a / (1 - r) = 10 / (1 - 0.2) = 10 / 0.8 = 12.5\n\n*   **Sum to infinity of Series B (S<sub>B</sub>):**\n\n    *   a = 5, r = 2 * 0.2 = 0.4\n    *   S<sub>B</sub> = a / (1 - r) = 5 / (1 - 0.4) = 5 / 0.6 = 25/3 \u2248 8.33\n\n*   **Difference between the sums (S<sub>A</sub> - S<sub>B</sub>):**\n\n    *   S<sub>A</sub> - S<sub>B</sub> = 12.5 - (25/3) = 12.5 - 8.33 = 4.17 (approximately)\n    *   Alternatively, S<sub>A</sub> - S<sub>B</sub> = 12.5 - (25/3) = 25/2 - 25/3 = (75 - 50)/6 = 25/6 \u2248 4.17\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe range of values for *x* for which both Series A and Series B converge to a finite sum is -1/2 < *x* < 1/2.  When *x* = 0.2, the difference between the sums to infinity of Series A and Series B is approximately 4.17 or exactly 25/6.\n\n3.  The exponential series can be used to approximate values of e^x. Use the first four terms of the exponential series to estimate the value of e^(0.5). Compare this approximation to the actual value (using a calculator) and discuss the trade-off between accuracy and the number of terms used in the approximation.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:\n\n**Question 3: The exponential series can be used to approximate values of e^x. Use the first four terms of the exponential series to estimate the value of e^(0.5). Compare this approximation to the actual value (using a calculator) and discuss the trade-off between accuracy and the number of terms used in the approximation.**\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe exponential series is a powerful tool for approximating values of  e^x. It's given by:\n\ne^x = 1 + x + (x^2)/2! + (x^3)/3! + (x^4)/4! + ...\n\nTo estimate e^(0.5) using the first four terms of this series, we substitute x = 0.5 into the formula:\n\ne^(0.5) \u2248 1 + 0.5 + (0.5^2)/2! + (0.5^3)/3!\n\nNow, let's calculate each term:\n\n*   1st term: 1\n*   2nd term: 0.5\n*   3rd term: (0.5^2) / 2! = 0.25 / 2 = 0.125\n*   4th term: (0.5^3) / 3! = 0.125 / 6 \u2248 0.02083\n\nTherefore, our approximation is:\n\ne^(0.5) \u2248 1 + 0.5 + 0.125 + 0.02083 = 1.64583\n\nNow, let's compare this to the actual value obtained using a calculator:\n\ne^(0.5) \u2248 1.64872 (using a calculator)\n\nThe absolute error in our approximation is:\n\n|1.64872 - 1.64583| \u2248 0.00289\n\n**Discussion on Accuracy and Trade-off:**\n\nAs you can see, using just the first four terms of the exponential series gives us a reasonably close approximation of e^(0.5). However, there's still a small error.\n\n*   **Accuracy:**  The accuracy of the approximation increases as we include more terms in the series. Each subsequent term contributes a smaller amount to the sum, but it helps to refine the estimate and reduce the error.\n\n*   **Trade-off:**  The trade-off is between accuracy and the computational effort required. Calculating more terms involves more arithmetic operations (exponentiation, division, addition). In situations where computational resources are limited, or a quick estimate is sufficient, using fewer terms might be preferred. However, if a high degree of accuracy is crucial, it's necessary to include more terms in the series.\n\nIn conclusion, the exponential series provides a valuable method for approximating values of e^x. By carefully considering the trade-off between accuracy and computational effort, we can choose an appropriate number of terms to achieve a desired level of precision. In this specific case, using just four terms provides a good estimate, and the error can be further reduced by including more terms.\n",

It introduces the binomial theorem for any index (not just positive integers), leading to binomial series. The chapter then explores infinite geometric series, including how to find their sum when the common ratio's absolute value is less than 1. Finally, it introduces exponential and logarithmic series, providing formulas and examples for their use.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n*   **Infinite Series:** The sum of an infinite sequence of numbers.\n*   **Binomial Theorem (Any Index):** An extension of the binomial theorem that allows for non-integer exponents, resulting in an infinite series.\n*   **Infinite Geometric Series:** A geometric series with an infinite number of terms.

The common ratio, *r*, is found by dividing any term by its preceding term (e.g., 2 / 6 = 1/3).  So, r = 1/3.\n\n2.  **Check |r| < 1:** Since |1/3| < 1, the infinite geometric series has a finite sum.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula:** The sum to infinity (S) is given by S = a / (1 - r).\n\n4.  **Substitute and calculate:** S = 6 / (1 - 1/3) = 6 / (2/3) = 6 * (3/2) = 9.\n\n**Therefore, the sum to infinity of the given geometric progression is 9.**\n\n### Definitions ###\nOkay, here's a breakdown of the Infinite Series chapter, explained simply:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis chapter expands on sequences and series, specifically looking at *infinite* series. It introduces the binomial theorem for any index (not just positive integers), infinite geometric series, exponential series, and logarithmic series. These are special types of infinite series with specific formulas and conditions for their use.\n\n**Definitions:**\n\n*   **Infinite Series:** An infinite series is the sum of all the terms in an infinite sequence. It's written like a1 + a2 + a3 + ... going on forever.\n*   **Binomial Theorem (Generalized):** This is a way to expand expressions like (1 + x)^m when 'm' is *any* number (positive, negative, fraction), not just a positive whole number. The result is an infinite series, but it's only valid when the absolute value of 'x' is less than 1 ( |x| < 1).\n*   **Infinite Geometric Series:** This is the sum of an infinite geometric sequence (where each term is multiplied by a constant 'r' to get the next term).  It has a special formula to find its sum *only* if the absolute value of the common ratio 'r' is less than 1 ( |r| < 1).\n*   **Exponential Series:** A specific infinite series that defines the number 'e' (Euler's number, approximately 2.718) and can be generalized to represent e^x.\n*   **Logarithmic Series:** An infinite series that represents the natural logarithm of (1 + x), denoted as loge(1 + x), valid for |x| < 1.\n\n**Solved Example:**\n\n**Problem:** Find the sum to infinity of the geometric progression: 9, 3, 1, 1/3, ...\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Identify 'a' and 'r':**\n    *   The first term, a = 9.\n    *   The common ratio, r = 3/9 = 1/3.\n\n2.  **Check the condition for the sum to infinity:**\n    *   |r| = |1/3| = 1/3, which is less than 1. So, we *can* use the formula.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula:**\n    *   Sum to infinity (S) = a / (1 - r)\n    *   S = 9 / (1 - 1/3)\n    *   S = 9 / (2/3)\n    *   S = 9 * (3/2)\n    *   S = 27/2 = 13.5\n\nTherefore, the sum to infinity of the given geometric progression is 13.5.\n\n### Solved Examples ###\nExpand \n1\n2\n1\n2\n(i)    \n2\n3\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n...\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n1\n2\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n=\n\u2212\n(ii)   \n2\n3\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n...\n1\n1\n2\n3\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n+\n=\n=\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n+\n\u2212\u2212\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n2024-25\nFind the sum to infinity of the G.P. ;\n5\n5\n5\n,\n,\n,....\n4\n16 64\n\u2212\n\u2212\nFind the coefficient of x2 in the expansion of  e2x+3 as a series in\nFind the value of e2, rounded off to one decimal place.\nTheorem If | x | < 1, then\n(\n)\n2\n3\nIf \n,\n\u03b1 \u03b2  are the roots of the equation \n2\n0\n\n### Exercises ###\nNo exercises found.\n\n"
