        "student_answer": "1.  **Conceptual Understanding of Spontaneity:** Explain, in your own words, why a process with a negative enthalpy change (\u0394H < 0) is not always spontaneous. Use the concepts of entropy and Gibbs Free Energy to support your explanation. Provide a real-world example to illustrate your point.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, designed for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nA negative enthalpy change (\u0394H < 0), which indicates an exothermic reaction releasing heat, favors spontaneity, but it doesn't guarantee it. This is because spontaneity is governed by the Gibbs Free Energy (\u0394G), which takes both enthalpy (\u0394H) and entropy (\u0394S) into account. The relationship is defined by the equation:\n\n**\u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S**\n\nWhere:\n\n*   \u0394G is the Gibbs Free Energy change\n*   \u0394H is the enthalpy change\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin\n*   \u0394S is the entropy change\n\nFor a process to be spontaneous, \u0394G must be negative. While a negative \u0394H contributes to a negative \u0394G, the entropy term (-T\u0394S) can counteract this effect.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Entropy (\u0394S):** Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system.  A positive \u0394S indicates an increase in disorder, which favors spontaneity. A negative \u0394S indicates a decrease in disorder, which opposes spontaneity.\n*   **The -T\u0394S Term:** The entropy change is multiplied by the temperature (T) and then subtracted from \u0394H. This means:\n    *   If \u0394S is positive, -T\u0394S is negative, which helps make \u0394G negative and favors spontaneity.\n    *   If \u0394S is negative, -T\u0394S is positive, which can make \u0394G positive, even if \u0394H is negative, thus hindering spontaneity.\n*   **Temperature Dependence:** The temperature (T) plays a crucial role. At high temperatures, the -T\u0394S term becomes more significant. Therefore, even if a reaction has a favorable (negative) \u0394H, it might become non-spontaneous at high temperatures if \u0394S is sufficiently negative. Conversely, a reaction with an unfavorable (positive) \u0394H might become spontaneous at high temperatures if \u0394S is sufficiently positive.\n\n**Real-World Example:**\n\nConsider the melting of ice:\n\nH2O(s)  -> H2O(l)\n\n*   **\u0394H:** Melting ice is an endothermic process; it requires energy input to break the hydrogen bonds holding the water molecules in the solid ice structure. Therefore, \u0394H is positive.\n*   **\u0394S:** When ice melts, the water molecules gain more freedom of movement, increasing the disorder. Therefore, \u0394S is positive.\n\nAt temperatures *below* 0\u00b0C (273.15 K), the positive \u0394H dominates, and \u0394G is positive. This means melting is non-spontaneous; ice remains frozen.\n\nAt temperatures *above* 0\u00b0C (273.15 K), the T\u0394S term becomes large enough to overcome the positive \u0394H, making \u0394G negative.  Therefore, melting is spontaneous, and ice melts.\n\nThis example demonstrates that even though melting ice requires energy input (positive \u0394H), it occurs spontaneously at higher temperatures because of the significant increase in entropy (positive \u0394S) associated with the phase change. The temperature determines whether the enthalpy or entropy term is dominant in determining the sign of \u0394G and, therefore, the spontaneity of the process.\n\n2.  **Applying Hess's Law:** Given the following thermochemical equations:\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer for the Hess's Law question, suitable for CBSE Class 11-12 students:\n\n**Question:**\n\n2. **Applying Hess's Law:** Given the following thermochemical equations:\n\n   A(s) + B(g) --> C(g)     \u0394H1 = -100 kJ\n   C(g) --> D(s) + E(g)     \u0394H2 = +50 kJ\n\n   Calculate the enthalpy change (\u0394H) for the reaction:\n\n   A(s) + B(g) --> D(s) + E(g)\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo determine the enthalpy change (\u0394H) for the reaction A(s) + B(g) --> D(s) + E(g), we can apply Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is independent of the path taken and depends only on the initial and final states.  This means we can manipulate the given thermochemical equations to arrive at the desired equation and then sum their enthalpy changes to find the overall \u0394H.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the target equation:**  We want to find the \u0394H for:\n\n    A(s) + B(g) --> D(s) + E(g)\n\n2.  **Manipulate the given equations:**\n\n    *   **Equation 1:** A(s) + B(g) --> C(g)     \u0394H1 = -100 kJ  (We can use this equation as is because A(s) and B(g) are on the reactant side, as in our target equation)\n\n    *   **Equation 2:** C(g) --> D(s) + E(g)     \u0394H2 = +50 kJ  (We can use this equation as is because D(s) and E(g) are on the product side, as in our target equation)\n\n3.  **Add the equations:** Now, add the two manipulated equations together. Notice that C(g) appears as a product in the first equation and as a reactant in the second.  This means it will cancel out when we add the equations:\n\n    A(s) + B(g) --> C(g)     \u0394H1 = -100 kJ\n    C(g) --> D(s) + E(g)     \u0394H2 = +50 kJ\n    ----------------------------------------------------\n    A(s) + B(g) --> D(s) + E(g)\n\n4.  **Calculate the overall \u0394H:**  Since we simply added the equations, we add their enthalpy changes:\n\n    \u0394H = \u0394H1 + \u0394H2\n    \u0394H = -100 kJ + 50 kJ\n    \u0394H = -50 kJ\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe enthalpy change (\u0394H) for the reaction A(s) + B(g) --> D(s) + E(g) is -50 kJ.  This indicates that the reaction is exothermic.\n\n3.  **Relating Thermodynamic Properties to Equilibrium:** A reaction is at equilibrium under standard conditions at a specific temperature. If, at this temperature, the change in enthalpy (\u0394H\u00b0) for the reaction is positive, what can you infer about the change in entropy (\u0394S\u00b0) for this reaction? Explain your reasoning using the relationship between \u0394G\u00b0, \u0394H\u00b0, \u0394S\u00b0, and the equilibrium state.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nWhen a reaction is at equilibrium, the change in Gibbs Free Energy (\u0394G\u00b0) is equal to zero.  The relationship between Gibbs Free Energy, enthalpy, and entropy is given by the equation:\n\n\u0394G\u00b0 = \u0394H\u00b0 - T\u0394S\u00b0\n\nWhere:\n\n*   \u0394G\u00b0 = Change in Gibbs Free Energy under standard conditions\n*   \u0394H\u00b0 = Change in Enthalpy under standard conditions\n*   T = Temperature (in Kelvin)\n*   \u0394S\u00b0 = Change in Entropy under standard conditions\n\nAt equilibrium, \u0394G\u00b0 = 0. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = \u0394H\u00b0 - T\u0394S\u00b0\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for \u0394S\u00b0:\n\nT\u0394S\u00b0 = \u0394H\u00b0\n\u0394S\u00b0 = \u0394H\u00b0 / T\n\nThe question states that \u0394H\u00b0 is positive. Since temperature (T) is always a positive value (in Kelvin), if \u0394H\u00b0 is positive, then \u0394S\u00b0 must also be positive.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nFor a reaction to be at equilibrium, the driving force towards product formation (related to enthalpy) must be balanced by the driving force towards disorder (related to entropy). If \u0394H\u00b0 is positive, this means the reaction is endothermic and disfavored in terms of enthalpy (it requires energy input). To compensate for this unfavorable enthalpy change and still achieve equilibrium, the entropy change (\u0394S\u00b0) must be positive and large enough to make the T\u0394S\u00b0 term equal to \u0394H\u00b0. A positive \u0394S\u00b0 indicates that the reaction leads to an increase in disorder or randomness, which favors the formation of products and counteracts the unfavorable enthalpy change, resulting in equilibrium. In simpler words, the increase in entropy must \"offset\" the energy needed for the reaction. Therefore, at equilibrium with a positive \u0394H\u00b0, \u0394S\u00b0 must be positive.\n",

It helps us predict whether a process will occur spontaneously and to what extent a reaction will proceed. Key concepts include systems and surroundings, internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. The laws of thermodynamics provide a framework for understanding energy conservation and the direction of spontaneous change.\n\n**Definitions**\n\n*   **System:** The specific part of the universe we're interested in observing (e.g., a reaction in a beaker).\n\n*   **Surroundings:** Everything else in the universe *outside* the system.\n\n*   **Internal Energy (U):** The total energy stored within a system (kinetic and potential energy of all its molecules). We usually focus on *changes* in internal energy (\u0394U).\n\n*   **Work (w):** Energy transferred when a force causes displacement (e.g., a gas expanding and pushing against a piston).\n\n*   **Heat (q):** Energy transferred due to a temperature difference between the system and surroundings.\n\n*   **Enthalpy (H):** A state function that combines internal energy, pressure, and volume (H = U + pV). Useful for reactions at constant pressure. The change in enthalpy (\u0394H) tells us if a reaction is exothermic (releases heat, \u0394H < 0) or endothermic (absorbs heat, \u0394H > 0).\n\n*   **State Function:** A property that depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not on the path taken to get there (e.g., internal energy, enthalpy, volume, temperature).\n\n*   **Entropy (S):** A measure of the disorder or randomness of a system.  Spontaneous processes tend to increase the overall entropy of the universe.\n\n*   **Gibbs Free Energy (G):** A thermodynamic potential that combines enthalpy and entropy (G = H - TS).
