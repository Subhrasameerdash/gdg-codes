        "student_answer": "1.  A clothing manufacturer produces three styles of shirts: A, B, and C. They use three different fabrics: cotton, polyester, and rayon. Shirt A requires 2 units of cotton, 1 unit of polyester, and 1 unit of rayon. Shirt B requires 3 units of cotton, 2 units of polyester, and no rayon. Shirt C requires 1 unit of cotton, 2 units of polyester, and 3 units of rayon. Represent the fabric requirements for each shirt style as a matrix. If the manufacturer has 240 units of cotton, 160 units of polyester, and 150 units of rayon available, can you determine a possible combination of shirt styles that would utilize all of the available fabric? (This tests understanding of matrix representation and relating it to a real-world problem).\nSample Answer:\nHere's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**Part 1: Matrix Representation of Fabric Requirements**\n\nLet's represent the fabric requirements for each shirt style (A, B, and C) as a matrix. We'll arrange the matrix so that rows represent the fabrics (cotton, polyester, rayon) and columns represent the shirt styles (A, B, C).\n\nLet matrix  `R` represent the fabric requirements:\n\n```\nR =  [ 2  3  1 ]\n     [ 1  2  2 ]\n     [ 1  0  3 ]\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n*   Row 1: Cotton requirements (Shirt A needs 2 units, Shirt B needs 3 units, Shirt C needs 1 unit)\n*   Row 2: Polyester requirements (Shirt A needs 1 unit, Shirt B needs 2 units, Shirt C needs 2 units)\n*   Row 3: Rayon requirements (Shirt A needs 1 unit, Shirt B needs 0 units, Shirt C needs 3 units)\n\n**Part 2: Determining a Possible Combination of Shirt Styles**\n\nLet's use variables to represent the number of each shirt style produced:\n\n*   `x` = Number of shirts of style A\n*   `y` = Number of shirts of style B\n*   `z` = Number of shirts of style C\n\nWe can set up a system of linear equations based on the available fabric:\n\n*   Cotton:  2*x + 3*y + z = 240\n*   Polyester: x + 2*y + 2*z = 160\n*   Rayon: x + 0*y + 3*z = 150  (or simply, x + 3z = 150)\n\nSolving this system of equations will give us a possible combination of shirt styles. Since we are looking for *a possible combination* and not necessarily *the only solution*, we can use a bit of strategic solving and make an assumption to simplify things.\nFrom the third equation, we have:\nx = 150 - 3z\n\nSubstituting this value of x in the first two equations:\n2(150 - 3z) + 3y + z = 240\n300 - 6z + 3y + z = 240\n3y - 5z = -60    ---(4)\n\n(150 - 3z) + 2y + 2z = 160\n2y - z = 10       ---(5)\n\nMultiply equation (5) by 3:\n6y - 3z = 30      ---(6)\n\nMultiply equation (4) by 2:\n6y - 10z = -120    ---(7)\n\nSubtract equation (7) from equation (6):\n7z = 150\nz = 150/7  (Not an integer, so we need to look for integer solutions)\n\nLet's solve this using gaussian elimination method using matrix algebra.\n\nWe can represent the system of linear equations in matrix form as follows:\n\n```\n| 2  3  1 | | x | = | 240 |\n| 1  2  2 | | y | = | 160 |\n| 1  0  3 | | z | = | 150 |\n```\n\nThis can be represented as AX = B, where\nA =\n```\n| 2  3  1 |\n| 1  2  2 |\n| 1  0  3 |\n```\nX =\n```\n| x |\n| y |\n| z |\n```\nB =\n```\n| 240 |\n| 160 |\n| 150 |\n```\nSolving this system can be done using various methods such as Gaussian elimination, or finding the inverse of A, and then X = A<sup>-1</sup>B.\n\nHowever, since the chapter content doesn't explicitly cover the solution of systems of linear equations using matrices, and we are allowed to make reasonable assumptions to simplify, Let's explore the integer solutions to these equations.\n\n**Simplified Method - Making Assumptions for integer solutions**\n\nFrom equation (5) 2y - z = 10, => z = 2y - 10\nFrom equation (4) 3y - 5z = -60 => 3y - 5(2y-10) = -60 => 3y - 10y + 50 = -60 => -7y = -110 => y = 110/7 which is also not an integer.\n\nLet's make an assumption: Suppose we make z = 40 then x = 150 - 3 * 40 = 150 - 120 = 30\nSubstituting in first two equations:\n2 * 30 + 3y + 40 = 240 => 3y = 140 => y = 140/3 (Not an integer)\n\nLet's make another assumption.\nWe know that x + 3z = 150,\nIf we want x to be a multiple of 3, so that when added to 3z, gives 150\nLet's assume x = 30\nSo 30 + 3z = 150\n3z = 120\nz = 40\n\nSubstitute x = 30 and z = 40 in equation 2.\n30 + 2y + 2*40 = 160\n2y + 110 = 160\n2y = 50\ny = 25\n\nSo we can take x = 30, y = 25, z = 40\nCheck this in the first equation:\n2*30 + 3*25 + 40 = 60 + 75 + 40 = 175 which is not 240\n\nLet's make another intelligent guess. We need to satisfy equation (1) 2x + 3y + z = 240 where values should be integers.\n\nLet's Assume:\nWe manufacture 20 shirts of style A, 40 shirts of style B and 20 shirts of Style C.\nx = 20, y = 40, z = 20.\nCotton: 2*20 + 3*40 + 20 = 40 + 120 + 20 = 180\nPolyester: 20 + 2*40 + 2*20 = 20 + 80 + 40 = 140\nRayon: 20 + 3*20 = 80\n\n**Another try:**\n\nLet's assume we manufacture 60 shirts of type C, so z = 60\nthen from equation (3) x + 3*60 = 150 => x = -30 which is not possible.\n\nIf z = 50 then x + 3*50 = 150 => x = 0\nFrom equation 2, 0 + 2y + 2*50 = 160 => y = 30\nCheck is equation 1. 2*0 + 3*30 + 50 = 140 which is not 240.\n\n**Final Solution:**\n\nAfter some hit and trial (since a matrix solver is not provided),\nLet x = 60, y = 20, z = 30\nCheck:\nCotton: 2*60 + 3*20 + 30 = 120 + 60 + 30 = 210 (Not equal to 240, so we can rule this out)\n\nLet's try to eliminate y from equations (1) and (2),\n\nMultiply eq(1) by 2 and eq(2) by 3\n4x + 6y + 2z = 480\n3x + 6y + 6z = 480\nSubtracting these equations\n\nx - 4z = 0\nx = 4z\n\nUsing equation (3) x + 3z = 150,\n=> 4z + 3z = 150\n=> 7z = 150\nz = 150/7\n\nHowever, since a possible answer requires integers, we can solve these equations with assumptions.\n\n**Therefore, one possible (approximate) combination is:**\nLet's find an approximate solution using matrix algebra:\nUsing online matrix calculator or software\n```\nInverse of Matrix A\nA<sup>-1</sup> = | -6/7   9/7  -4/7 |\n         |  1/7  -5/7   3/7 |\n         |  2/7  -3/7   1/7 |\n```\n\nNow,\nX = A<sup>-1</sup>B\n```\n| x |  = | -6/7   9/7  -4/7 | | 240 |\n| y |  = |  1/7  -5/7   3/7 | | 160 |\n| z |  = |  2/7  -3/7   1/7 | | 150 |\n```\n\nx = (-6/7) * 240 + (9/7) * 160 + (-4/7) * 150 =  240/7 = 34.3\ny = (1/7) * 240 + (-5/7) * 160 + (3/7) * 150 =  5/7 = 0.7\nz = (2/7) * 240 + (-3/7) * 160 + (1/7) * 150 =  30/7 = 4.3\n\nBased on these values, let's select integer values. x=34, y=1, z=4\n\nCotton: 2*34 + 3*1 + 4 = 68 + 3 + 4 = 75 which is not 240\nSo this can't be possible.\n\n```\nSince we are not able to derive integer answers from here, it requires knowledge of linear programming\nWe can say, this question needs more work, and requires linear programming to solve, hence we say that a possible answer requires methods not explained.\n```\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   This solution demonstrates how matrix representation can be used to model a real-world problem.\n*   Finding the *exact* integer solution to this system of equations efficiently can be done with linear programming or more advanced matrix techniques, but the question just asked for *a possible combination*, which can be found by assuming one of the number of shirts.\n*   Emphasis is placed on showing the process and logic, which is crucial for demonstrating understanding.\n\n2.  Given two matrices, A and B, where A is a 2x3 matrix and B is a 3x2 matrix.  Explain why both AB and BA are defined, but they cannot be equal unless specific conditions are met. Further, provide an example of such matrices A and B where AB and BA are both defined, but of different orders. Explain why the resulting matrices are of different orders. (This question assesses understanding of matrix multiplication and its properties.)\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet's consider two matrices, A and B. A is a 2x3 matrix, meaning it has 2 rows and 3 columns. B is a 3x2 matrix, with 3 rows and 2 columns.\n\n**Why AB and BA are both defined:**\n\n*   **Matrix Multiplication Rule:**  For the product of two matrices to be defined, the number of columns in the first matrix *must* be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.\n\n*   **AB:**  To find the product AB, we are multiplying a 2x3 matrix (A) by a 3x2 matrix (B). The number of columns in A (which is 3) is equal to the number of rows in B (which is also 3). Therefore, the matrix product AB is defined.  The resulting matrix AB will have the dimensions 2x2 (number of rows of A x number of columns of B).\n\n*   **BA:** To find the product BA, we are multiplying a 3x2 matrix (B) by a 2x3 matrix (A). The number of columns in B (which is 2) is equal to the number of rows in A (which is also 2). Therefore, the matrix product BA is defined. The resulting matrix BA will have the dimensions 3x3 (number of rows of B x number of columns of A).\n\n**Why AB and BA are generally not equal:**\n\nEven though both AB and BA are defined, they are generally not equal for two main reasons:\n\n1.  **Order (Dimensions):** As explained above, AB results in a 2x2 matrix, while BA results in a 3x3 matrix. Matrices of different orders cannot be equal.  Equality of matrices requires them to have the same dimensions *and* the corresponding elements to be equal.\n\n2.  **Non-Commutativity:** Matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. This means that the order in which you multiply matrices matters. Even if AB and BA had the same dimensions (which is possible with square matrices under specific conditions), the elements of AB would usually be different from the elements of BA.\n\n**Example of A and B where AB and BA are defined but of different orders:**\n\nLet's take two simple matrices:\n\nA = \\[ 1 2 3\n                4 5 6 ] (2x3 matrix)\n\nB = \\[ 7 8\n                9 10\n               11 12] (3x2 matrix)\n\n*   **AB (2x2 matrix):**\n\nAB = \\[ (1\\*7 + 2\\*9 + 3\\*11) (1\\*8 + 2\\*10 + 3\\*12)\n               (4\\*7 + 5\\*9 + 6\\*11) (4\\*8 + 5\\*10 + 6\\*12) ]\n\nAB = \\[ 58 64\n               139 154] (2x2 matrix)\n\n*   **BA (3x3 matrix):**\n\nBA = \\[ (7\\*1 + 8\\*4) (7\\*2 + 8\\*5) (7\\*3 + 8\\*6)\n            (9\\*1 + 10\\*4) (9\\*2 + 10\\*5) (9\\*3 + 10\\*6)\n           (11\\*1 + 12\\*4) (11\\*2 + 12\\*5) (11\\*3 + 12\\*6) ]\n\nBA = \\[ 39 54 69\n            49 68 87\n            59 82 105] (3x3 matrix)\n\nAs you can see, AB is a 2x2 matrix, and BA is a 3x3 matrix.  Therefore, they are of different orders.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn summary, for matrices A (2x3) and B (3x2), both AB and BA are defined because the dimensions allow for matrix multiplication. However, AB results in a 2x2 matrix, while BA results in a 3x3 matrix. Because the resulting matrices have different dimensions, they cannot be equal. Also, this example shows that matrix multiplication is not commutative.\n\n3.  A square matrix A satisfies the equation A\u00b2 - 5A + 7I = 0, where I is the identity matrix of the same order as A, and 0 is the null matrix. Prove that A is invertible, and find an expression for the inverse of A in terms of A and I. (This question probes deeper understanding of matrix algebra, invertibility, and how to manipulate matrix equations.)\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT content and tailored to the given assignment question:\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe are given a square matrix *A* that satisfies the equation A\u00b2 - 5A + 7I = 0.  Our goal is to show that *A* is invertible (meaning it has an inverse, denoted by A\u207b\u00b9) and to find a formula for A\u207b\u00b9 using *A* and *I*.\n\n**Proof of Invertibility and Finding the Inverse:**\n\n1.  **Start with the given equation:**\n\n    A\u00b2 - 5A + 7I = 0\n\n2.  **Isolate the term with the identity matrix:**\n\n    7I = -A\u00b2 + 5A\n\n3.  **Factor out *A* from the right-hand side (RHS):**\n\n    7I = A(-A + 5I)  or 7I = (-A + 5I)A\n\n4.  **Divide both sides by 7:**\n\n    I = A((-1/7)A + (5/7)I) or I = ((-1/7)A + (5/7)I)A\n\n5.  **Recognize the form of the inverse:**\n\n    Recall that if AB = I = BA, then B is the inverse of A (B = A\u207b\u00b9).  Comparing this with our equation, we can see that:\n\n    A\u207b\u00b9 = (-1/7)A + (5/7)I\n\n    Therefore:\n\n    A\u207b\u00b9 = (1/7)(5I - A)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe have shown that the matrix *A* is invertible, and its inverse, A\u207b\u00b9, can be expressed as (1/7)(5I - A), where *I* is the identity matrix of the same order as *A*.\n\n**Explanation of Key Steps:**\n\n*   **Starting with the given equation:** This is the foundation of the problem. We manipulate this equation to isolate *I*.\n*   **Factoring out A:**  This is a crucial step to get the equation into the form AB = I, which allows us to identify A\u207b\u00b9. Matrix multiplication is distributive, allowing us to factor out A.\n*   **Recognizing the Inverse:** The definition of the inverse matrix is that when multiplied by the original matrix, it yields the identity matrix. We use this definition to identify the expression for A\u207b\u00b9.\n*   **Expressing A\u207b\u00b9 in terms of A and I:** The final answer expresses the inverse matrix using only the original matrix *A* and the identity matrix *I*, as required by the problem.\n",

The student correctly represents the fabric requirements as a matrix and sets up the system of linear equations. However, the attempt to solve the system is inefficient and doesn't lead to a correct, verifiable solution using methods appropriate for the class level (without resorting to complex matrix algebra or linear programming). The student gets bogged down in \"hit and trial\" integer solutions and acknowledges the need for linear programming, which is beyond the scope of a basic matrices chapter. A better approach would have been to provide *one* reasonable combination based on simplifying assumptions, rather than getting lost in a maze of calculations. The inverse matrix provided is incorrectly calculated.\n*   **Clarity:** The initial matrix representation and equation setup are clear. The explanation of each variable and row is good. However, the lengthy, unsuccessful attempts to solve the system introduce confusion and detract from the clarity.  The final \"since we are not able to derive integer answers from here\" section is honest but demonstrates a failure to find a solution within the intended scope.\n*   **Structure:**  The answer is structured into two main parts: matrix representation and solution attempt. The representation is well-structured. However, the solution section lacks focus. The multiple attempts and assumptions make it disorganized and hard to follow. The conclusion is weak because it doesn't offer a valid solution.\n\n**Areas for Improvement (Question 1):**\n\n*   **Focus on Simplicity:** The key to this question is to *demonstrate understanding* of matrix representation and how it connects to a system of equations. The question asks for \"a possible combination,\" not \"the only solution\" or \"the optimal solution.\" The student should have focused on making a reasonable assumption to simplify the system and arrive at a valid (even if not perfectly accurate) solution. For example, assuming x=0 and solving for y and z.\n*   **Avoid Unnecessary Complexity:**  Gaussian elimination and attempts at finding the inverse matrix are unnecessary and demonstrate an overreach given the context. They should be avoided unless the system of equations is directly solvable.\n*   **Present a Clear Conclusion:** The answer should conclude with a concrete proposed combination of shirts (even if it's slightly off in terms of perfectly using all materials) and a clear statement that it's a *possible* (not necessarily the best) solution.\n\n**Question 2: Matrix Multiplication Properties**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** 20/20. The student correctly explains why AB and BA are defined and why they are generally not equal (different orders, non-commutativity). The example matrices provided and the calculations are correct.\n*   **Clarity:** The explanation is very clear and easy to understand. The use of bullet points helps to organize the information.\n*   **Structure:** The answer is well-structured, with a clear explanation of the rules, reasons, and an illustrative example.\n\n**Question 3: Matrix Invertibility**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** 10/20. The student provides the correct process for demonstrating the invertibility of matrix A and deriving the inverse, with the correct final result.\n*   **Clarity:** The explanation is mostly clear, but could benefit from more explicit annotations about *why* each step is being taken (e.g., \"We factor out A to isolate a term that can be recognized as the inverse\").\n*   **Structure:** The answer is logically structured, following the steps of algebraic manipulation to arrive at the solution.\n\n**General Strengths:**\n\n*   The student demonstrates a good understanding of matrix representation and basic matrix multiplication properties.\n*   The answers are generally well-written and use appropriate mathematical notation.\n*   The student attempts to apply relevant concepts.\n\n**General Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Problem-Solving Strategy:** The student needs to develop a more focused and efficient problem-solving strategy, especially when dealing with word problems.  Focus on the *core concept* being tested and avoid getting sidetracked by unnecessary complexity.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The student should always verify their proposed solutions (e.g., plug the shirt numbers back into the fabric equations to check if they are close to the available amounts).\n\nIn summary, the student shows promise but needs to refine their problem-solving approach and focus on providing clear, concise solutions that directly address the question's core requirements."
