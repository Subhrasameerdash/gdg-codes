        "student_answer": "1.  A coding system uses symbols chosen from a set of 6 distinct characters. A valid code consists of 5 symbols, where repetition of symbols is allowed, but two adjacent symbols must be different. Determine the total number of valid codes that can be generated using this system.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the given assignment question based on the provided NCERT chapter content:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo determine the number of valid codes, we need to consider the constraints of the coding system:\n\n*   **6 distinct characters:** We have 6 options for each symbol in the code.\n*   **5 symbols per code:** The code has a length of 5.\n*   **Repetition allowed:** A symbol can be used multiple times in a code.\n*   **Adjacent symbols must be different:**  No two consecutive symbols can be the same.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1.  **First Symbol:** For the first symbol in the code, we have complete freedom. We can choose any of the 6 characters.  So, there are 6 possibilities.\n\n2.  **Second Symbol:**  Since the second symbol cannot be the same as the first, we only have 5 choices for the second symbol (any of the 6 characters *except* the one we used for the first symbol).\n\n3.  **Third Symbol:**  Similarly, the third symbol cannot be the same as the *second* symbol. Therefore, we again have 5 choices for the third symbol.\n\n4.  **Fourth Symbol:** The fourth symbol cannot be the same as the third symbol.  So, we have 5 choices.\n\n5.  **Fifth Symbol:**  The fifth symbol cannot be the same as the fourth symbol.  Again, we have 5 choices.\n\nTherefore, to find the total number of valid codes, we multiply the number of choices for each position:\n\nTotal valid codes = (Choices for 1st symbol) * (Choices for 2nd symbol) * (Choices for 3rd symbol) * (Choices for 4th symbol) * (Choices for 5th symbol)\n\nTotal valid codes = 6 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 6 * 5<sup>4</sup> = 6 * 625 = 3750\n\n**Therefore, the total number of valid codes that can be generated using this system is 3750.**\n\n2.  A school is organizing a debate team consisting of 6 students. From a pool of 8 boys and 5 girls, how many different debate teams can be formed if the team must have at least 2 girls and at least 3 boys?\nSample Answer:\nHere's a breakdown of the solution for the debate team selection problem, suitable for a class 11-12 student:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe need to form a debate team of 6 students from 8 boys and 5 girls, with the constraint that there must be at least 2 girls and at least 3 boys. This means we need to consider different possible combinations of boys and girls that satisfy these conditions.\n\n**Possible Cases:**\n\nLet's list the possible combinations of boys and girls that meet the criteria:\n\n*   **Case 1:** 3 Boys and 3 Girls\n*   **Case 2:** 4 Boys and 2 Girls\n*   **Case 3:** 5 Boys and 1 Girl\n*   **Case 4:** 6 Boys and 0 Girls\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nWe'll use combinations (denoted as <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> or  nCr, which means \"n choose r\") to calculate the number of ways to select students for each case. Remember that the formula for combinations is:\n\n nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\n* **Case 1: 3 Boys and 3 Girls**\n\n    *   Number of ways to choose 3 boys from 8:  <sup>8</sup>C<sub>3</sub> = 8! / (3! * 5!) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56\n    *   Number of ways to choose 3 girls from 5: <sup>5</sup>C<sub>3</sub> = 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 10\n    *   Total ways for Case 1: 56 * 10 = 560\n\n*   **Case 2: 4 Boys and 2 Girls**\n\n    *   Number of ways to choose 4 boys from 8: <sup>8</sup>C<sub>4</sub> = 8! / (4! * 4!) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 70\n    *   Number of ways to choose 2 girls from 5: <sup>5</sup>C<sub>2</sub> = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 10\n    *   Total ways for Case 2: 70 * 10 = 700\n\n*   **Case 3: 5 Boys and 1 Girl**\n\n    *   Number of ways to choose 5 boys from 8: <sup>8</sup>C<sub>5</sub> = 8! / (5! * 3!) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56\n    *   Number of ways to choose 1 girl from 5: <sup>5</sup>C<sub>1</sub> = 5! / (1! * 4!) = 5\n    *   Total ways for Case 3: 56 * 5 = 280\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nTo get the total number of different debate teams that can be formed, we add the number of ways for each case:\n\nTotal ways = 560 + 700 + 280 = 1540\n\n**Therefore, 1540 different debate teams can be formed.**\n**Alternative Explanation:**\nAfter identifying the cases\n*   **Case 1:** 3 Boys and 3 Girls\n*   **Case 2:** 4 Boys and 2 Girls\n\nIt is important to understand that the question asks for *at least* 2 girls and *at least* 3 boys.\nOther possible cases such as 5 boys and 1 girl or 6 boys are invalid because the prompt explicitly states that the team has to contain *at least* 2 girls.\n\nTotal ways = 560 + 700 = 1260\n\n3.  Consider the word \"MISSISSIPPI\". Determine the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in this word. Additionally, calculate how many of these arrangements have all the 'S' characters appearing consecutively.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a sample answer to the question, suitable for CBSE Class 11-12 students, based on the provided NCERT chapter content on Permutations and Combinations:\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**(a) Total number of distinct arrangements of the letters in \"MISSISSIPPI\":**\n\nThe word \"MISSISSIPPI\" has 11 letters in total. The letters are:\n\n*   M: 1\n*   I: 4\n*   S: 4\n*   P: 2\n\nIf all the letters were distinct, we would have 11! arrangements. However, since we have repeating letters, we need to divide by the factorial of the count of each repeating letter to correct for overcounting.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is:\n\n11! / (1! * 4! * 4! * 2!) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 24 * 24 * 2) = 34650\n\nSo, there are 34,650 distinct arrangements of the letters in the word \"MISSISSIPPI\".\n\n**(b) Number of arrangements with all 'S' characters appearing consecutively:**\n\nIf all the 'S' characters must appear together, we can treat the four 'S' characters as a single unit or \"block\" (SSSS). Now we have to arrange the following \"letters/blocks\":\n\n*   M: 1\n*   I: 4\n*   P: 2\n*   (SSSS): 1  (The block of four S's)\n\nNow we have a total of 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 8 \"letters/blocks\" to arrange.  Again, we have repeating 'I's and 'P's, so we need to account for that.\n\nThe number of arrangements is:\n\n8! / (1! * 4! * 2! * 1!) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (1 * 24 * 2 * 1) = 840\n\nTherefore, there are 840 arrangements of the letters in \"MISSISSIPPI\" where all the 'S' characters appear consecutively.\n",
