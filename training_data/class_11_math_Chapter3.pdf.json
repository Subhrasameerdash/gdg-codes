        "student_answer": "1.  A pendulum swings through an angle of 30 degrees. If the length of the pendulum is 75 cm, find the total distance its tip travels after making 10 complete oscillations. Express your answer in terms of \u03c0.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student based on the provided NCERT chapter content.  The answer is broken down into clear steps with explanations.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe need to find the total distance the tip of a pendulum travels after 10 complete oscillations, given the angle of swing and the pendulum's length. Each swing forms an arc of a circle.  The length of the arc is the distance the tip travels in one swing.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1.  **Convert the angle to radians:**\n    The angle of swing is given as 30 degrees. We need to convert this to radians because the formula *l = r\u03b8* (where *l* is arc length, *r* is radius, and *\u03b8* is the angle in radians) requires the angle to be in radians.\n\n    We know that 180 degrees = \u03c0 radians. Therefore,\n\n    30 degrees = (30/180) * \u03c0 radians = \u03c0/6 radians\n\n2.  **Find the arc length of one swing:**\n\n    The length of the pendulum is the radius of the circular arc, so *r* = 75 cm.  The angle is *\u03b8* = \u03c0/6 radians.\n\n    Using the formula *l = r\u03b8*, the arc length of one swing is:\n\n    *l* = 75 * (\u03c0/6) = (75\u03c0)/6 = (25\u03c0)/2 cm\n\n3.  **Consider one complete oscillation:**\n\n    One *complete oscillation* means the pendulum swings to one side *and* back to its starting position.  Therefore, in one complete oscillation, the tip travels *twice* the arc length we calculated in step 2.\n\n    Distance of one complete oscillation = 2 * (25\u03c0)/2  = 25\u03c0 cm\n\n4.  **Calculate the total distance for 10 oscillations:**\n\n    Since the pendulum makes 10 complete oscillations, the total distance traveled is:\n\n    Total distance = 10 * (25\u03c0) = 250\u03c0 cm\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe total distance the tip of the pendulum travels after making 10 complete oscillations is **250\u03c0 cm**.\n\n2.  Given that sin(\u03b8) = p, where \u03c0/2 < \u03b8 < \u03c0, express all other trigonometric ratios in terms of *p*. Justify the sign of each ratio you determine.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter summary and solved examples.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nGiven: sin(\u03b8) = *p*, where \u03c0/2 < \u03b8 < \u03c0. This means \u03b8 lies in the second quadrant.  We need to find all other trigonometric ratios in terms of *p* and justify their signs.\n\n1. **Cosine (cos \u03b8):**\n\n   We know that sin\u00b2(\u03b8) + cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1.  Therefore, cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1 - sin\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1 - *p*\u00b2.\n\n   So, cos(\u03b8) = \u00b1\u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2).\n\n   Since \u03b8 lies in the second quadrant, cosine is negative. Therefore,\n\n   **cos(\u03b8) = -\u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2)**\n\n   *Justification:* In the second quadrant (\u03c0/2 < \u03b8 < \u03c0), the x-coordinate is negative, and cosine represents the x-coordinate on the unit circle.\n\n2. **Tangent (tan \u03b8):**\n\n   We know that tan(\u03b8) = sin(\u03b8) / cos(\u03b8).\n\n   Therefore, tan(\u03b8) = *p* / (-\u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2)) = **- *p* / \u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2)**\n\n   *Justification:* In the second quadrant, sine is positive, and cosine is negative. Therefore, tangent (sine/cosine) is negative.\n\n3. **Cosecant (csc \u03b8):**\n\n   Cosecant is the reciprocal of sine: csc(\u03b8) = 1 / sin(\u03b8).\n\n   Therefore, csc(\u03b8) = **1 / *p***\n\n   *Justification:* In the second quadrant, sine is positive. Therefore, its reciprocal, cosecant, is also positive.\n\n4. **Secant (sec \u03b8):**\n\n   Secant is the reciprocal of cosine: sec(\u03b8) = 1 / cos(\u03b8).\n\n   Therefore, sec(\u03b8) = 1 / (-\u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2)) = **-1 / \u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2)**\n\n   *Justification:* In the second quadrant, cosine is negative. Therefore, its reciprocal, secant, is also negative.\n\n5. **Cotangent (cot \u03b8):**\n\n   Cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent: cot(\u03b8) = 1 / tan(\u03b8).\n\n   Therefore, cot(\u03b8) = 1 / (- *p* / \u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2)) = **-\u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2) / *p***\n\n   *Justification:* In the second quadrant, tangent is negative. Therefore, its reciprocal, cotangent, is also negative.\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Trigonometric Ratio | Value in terms of *p* | Sign in Quadrant II |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|\n| sin(\u03b8)                | *p*                               | +                   |\n| cos(\u03b8)                | -\u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2)                     | -                   |\n| tan(\u03b8)                | - *p* / \u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2)              | -                   |\n| csc(\u03b8)                | 1 / *p*                           | +                   |\n| sec(\u03b8)                | -1 / \u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2)                  | -                   |\n| cot(\u03b8)                | -\u221a(1 - *p*\u00b2) / *p*              | -                   |\n\n**Important Considerations for Students:**\n\n*   **Understanding Quadrants:** Make sure you thoroughly understand which trigonometric ratios are positive and negative in each quadrant (ASTC rule or \"All Students Take Calculus\"). This is crucial for determining the correct sign.\n*   **Pythagorean Identity:** The fundamental identity sin\u00b2(\u03b8) + cos\u00b2(\u03b8) = 1 is the foundation for solving many trigonometric problems.\n*   **Reciprocal Identities:** Remember the definitions of cosecant, secant, and cotangent as reciprocals of sine, cosine, and tangent, respectively.\n*   **Clear Justification:** Always provide a clear justification for the sign of each trigonometric ratio based on the quadrant in which the angle lies.\n*   **Domain and Range:** Although not directly applicable in this problem, be mindful of the domain and range of each trigonometric function. For example, 1 - p^2 must be >=0, and p must be within the range of sine for the second quadrant (0 < p <= 1).\n\n3.  Without using a calculator, prove the following trigonometric identity:\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content.  I'll assume the identity to be proven is one that's reasonably likely to appear based on the examples and exercises referenced. Let's assume the identity to be proven is:\n\n**Prove that:  `tan 3x tan 2x tan x = tan 3x - tan 2x - tan x`**\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo prove the trigonometric identity `tan 3x tan 2x tan x = tan 3x - tan 2x - tan x`, we will start with the identity for `tan(A - B)`.\n\nWe know that:\n\n`tan(A - B) = (tan A - tan B) / (1 + tan A tan B)`\n\nNow, consider `3x = 2x + x`.  Therefore, we can write:\n\n`tan 3x = tan(2x + x)`\n\nUsing the tangent addition formula:  `tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)`, we get:\n\n`tan 3x = (tan 2x + tan x) / (1 - tan 2x tan x)`\n\nNow, multiply both sides by `(1 - tan 2x tan x)`:\n\n`tan 3x * (1 - tan 2x tan x) = tan 2x + tan x`\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n`tan 3x - tan 3x tan 2x tan x = tan 2x + tan x`\n\nNow, rearrange the terms to isolate the desired expression:\n\n`tan 3x - tan 2x - tan x = tan 3x tan 2x tan x`\n\nTherefore:\n\n`tan 3x tan 2x tan x = tan 3x - tan 2x - tan x`\n\n**Hence Proved.**\n\n**Explanation of Steps:**\n\n1.  **Start with a Known Identity:** The solution begins by recalling the tangent addition formula, a fundamental trigonometric identity.\n\n2.  **Relate the Angles:** The problem cleverly utilizes the relationship `3x = 2x + x` to connect the terms in the desired identity.\n\n3.  **Apply the Addition Formula:** The tangent addition formula is applied to `tan(2x + x)` to express `tan 3x` in terms of `tan 2x` and `tan x`.\n\n4.  **Rearrange and Simplify:**  The equation is then manipulated algebraically to isolate the term `tan 3x tan 2x tan x` on one side, resulting in the required identity.  The key step is multiplying both sides by the denominator and then carefully rearranging the terms.\n\n**Why this answer is good for Class 11-12:**\n\n*   **Clear and Concise:**  The steps are presented in a logical order, making it easy to follow the reasoning.\n*   **Uses Appropriate Language:** The explanation uses standard trigonometric terminology.\n*   **Focuses on Key Concepts:** The solution relies on a fundamental trigonometric identity (the tangent addition formula), which is a core concept for this level.\n*   **Provides Justification:** Each step is explained, providing a clear understanding of why it is being performed.\n*   **No Calculator Required:** The solution adheres to the problem constraint of not using a calculator.\n\nThis example demonstrates how to construct a complete and well-explained answer to a trigonometry problem, suitable for a high school student.  Remember to always start with known identities and manipulate them to arrive at the desired result.\n",

The correct formulas are applied, and the calculations are performed mostly without error.  The first two solutions are entirely correct. The choice of identity to prove in the third question is a good one, and the *proof* is correct.\n*   **Clarity (28/30):** The explanations are clear and easy to understand. The student breaks down each step of the solution process, providing a rationale for each action. The student also includes helpful reminders (\"Important Considerations for Students\") in the second answer, reinforcing key concepts. The \"Understanding the Problem\" section in the first answer sets the stage well.\n*   **Structure (27/30):** The answers are well-structured and logically organized.  Each problem is clearly defined, followed by a step-by-step solution and a final answer. Numbering the steps enhances the clarity. The inclusion of a summary table in the second answer is a nice touch.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Completeness relative to Model (0/10, this is where the big hit is):** This is where the student answer falls short. The \"model answer\" isn't really a model answer in the traditional sense. It's an *outline* of a chapter from an NCERT textbook. It includes definitions and examples, but it does *not* provide solutions to specific problems. Therefore, the student *cannot* directly compare their answer to the model answer. This makes evaluating completeness difficult. However, since the instructions were to assess \"relative to the model answer,\" and the student answer *does not* directly reference any content from the provided model answer, I have to mark this down.  The provided answers *could* incorporate definitions listed in the model, or directly use solved examples from the model as part of their proofs, or explicitly reference a theorem from the list. They do not.\n*   **Formatting:** While the formatting is generally good, the student's answers include \"Sample Answer\" prefixes and other conversational elements. While this mirrors the prompt instructions, it's better to remove these in a final answer.\n\n**Specific Suggestions:**\n\n*   **Explicitly connect answers to the chapter summary.** The student needs to reference specific definitions, formulas, or examples from the model answer *within* their solutions. For example, in the first problem, the student could explicitly state: \"As defined in the textbook summary, if in a circle of radius r, an arc of length l subtends an angle of \u03b8 radians, then l = r\u03b8.\"\n*   **Incorporate examples from the textbook summary:** In the second problem, when justifying the sign of trigonometric functions in the second quadrant, the student could cite a solved example from the provided summary (if one exists that deals with signs in quadrants).\n*   **Refine the Introduction/Conclusion:** Each answer should have a brief introduction outlining the problem and the approach to be taken, and a concise conclusion summarizing the results. Avoid the \"Okay, here's a sample answer...\" phrasing.\n*   **Strengthen Justification:** While the justifications are good, they could be made even stronger by referencing relevant theorems or properties.\n\n**Revised Example of Improvement (for the first problem):**\n\n**Problem:** A pendulum swings through an angle of 30 degrees. If the length of the pendulum is 75 cm, find the total distance its tip travels after making 10 complete oscillations. Express your answer in terms of \u03c0.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThis problem requires us to calculate the total distance traveled by the tip of a pendulum after 10 complete oscillations, given its length and swing angle.  We will use the formula relating arc length, radius, and angle in radians.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1.  **Convert the angle to radians:** As defined in the textbook summary, angles used in calculations with arc length must be in radians. We know that 180 degrees = \u03c0 radians. Therefore, 30 degrees = (30/180) * \u03c0 radians = \u03c0/6 radians\n\n2.  **Find the arc length of one swing:**\n\n    The length of the pendulum is the radius of the circular arc, so *r* = 75 cm.  The angle is *\u03b8* = \u03c0/6 radians.  As the textbook summary states, *l = r\u03b8*, so the arc length of one swing is:\n\n    *l* = 75 * (\u03c0/6) = (75\u03c0)/6 = (25\u03c0)/2 cm\n\n3.  **Consider one complete oscillation:**\n\n    One complete oscillation means the pendulum swings to one side *and* back to its starting position.  Therefore, in one complete oscillation, the tip travels *twice* the arc length we calculated in step 2.\n\n    Distance of one complete oscillation = 2 * (25\u03c0)/2  = 25\u03c0 cm\n\n4.  **Calculate the total distance for 10 oscillations:**\n\n    Since the pendulum makes 10 complete oscillations, the total distance traveled is:\n\n    Total distance = 10 * (25\u03c0) = 250\u03c0 cm\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe total distance the tip of the pendulum travels after making 10 complete oscillations is 250\u03c0 cm.\n"
