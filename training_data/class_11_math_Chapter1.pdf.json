        "student_answer": "1.  **Defining Set Equality:** Consider two sets, *P* and *Q*. Set *P* is defined as all perfect squares less than 100 that are also even numbers. Set *Q* is defined as {4, 16, 36, 64}. Are sets *P* and *Q* equal? Justify your answer by clearly explaining the conditions required for set equality and demonstrating whether those conditions are met in this specific case.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:\n\nTo determine if sets *P* and *Q* are equal, we need to understand the condition for set equality: Two sets are equal if and only if they contain exactly the same elements. This means every element in *P* must also be in *Q*, and every element in *Q* must also be in *P*.\n\nLet's first define set *P*: *P* is the set of all perfect squares less than 100 that are also even numbers.  We need to list out the perfect squares less than 100:\n\n1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81\n\nNow, we identify which of these are even numbers:\n\n4, 16, 36, 64\n\nTherefore, set *P* = {4, 16, 36, 64}.\n\nSet *Q* is given as {4, 16, 36, 64}.\n\nComparing the two sets:\n\n*   Set *P* contains the elements 4, 16, 36, and 64.\n*   Set *Q* contains the elements 4, 16, 36, and 64.\n\nSince both sets contain exactly the same elements, we can conclude that set *P* is equal to set *Q*.\n\n**Therefore, P = Q.**\n\n2.  **Subset Identification and Set Operations:** Let U = {x | x is a vowel in the English alphabet}, A = {a, e}, and B = {i, o, u}. First, determine if A is a subset of B, and if B is a subset of U. Explain your reasoning. Then, find A \u222a B and (A \u222a B)'.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a sample answer suitable for CBSE Class 11-12 students based on the provided NCERT chapter content.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**1. Subset Identification:**\n\n*   **Is A a subset of B?** No.  A = {a, e} and B = {i, o, u}.  For A to be a subset of B, every element of A must also be an element of B.  Since 'a' and 'e' are in A but not in B, A is not a subset of B. We can denote this as A \u2288 B.\n\n*   **Is B a subset of U?** Yes.  U = {a, e, i, o, u} (the set of all vowels), and B = {i, o, u}.  Every element of B (i, o, and u) is also an element of U. Therefore, B is a subset of U. We can denote this as B \u2286 U.\n\n**2. Set Operations:**\n\n*   **A \u222a B (Union of A and B):** The union of two sets A and B is a set containing all the elements that are in A, or in B, or in both.\n    A = {a, e} and B = {i, o, u}.\n    Therefore, A \u222a B = {a, e, i, o, u}.\n\n*   **(A \u222a B)' (Complement of A \u222a B):** The complement of a set (A \u222a B) is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are *not* in (A \u222a B).  In this case, U = {a, e, i, o, u}.\n    Since A \u222a B = {a, e, i, o, u}, and U = {a, e, i, o, u}, there are no elements in U that are not in A \u222a B.\n    Therefore, (A \u222a B)' = {} or \u03c6 (the empty set).\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   A is not a subset of B (A \u2288 B).\n*   B is a subset of U (B \u2286 U).\n*   A \u222a B = {a, e, i, o, u}\n*   (A \u222a B)' = {} or \u03c6\n\n3.  **Applying Set Builder Notation and Set Complement:** A universal set, U, consists of all positive integers less than 20. Set A is defined as {x | x \u2208 U and x is a multiple of 3}.  Set B is defined as {x | x \u2208 U and x is a prime number}. Determine A', B', and A' \u2229 B'. Express each of your resulting sets using the roster method.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**Understanding the Question**\n\nThe question requires us to work with set builder notation, a universal set, multiples, prime numbers, set complements, and the intersection of sets. We need to express the final answers in roster form.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1.  **Define the Universal Set (U):**\n\n    The universal set U is the set of all positive integers less than 20.  Therefore, in roster form:\n\n    U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}\n\n2.  **Define Set A:**\n\n    Set A is defined as {x | x \u2208 U and x is a multiple of 3}. This means A contains all elements from U that are multiples of 3. Therefore:\n\n    A = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}\n\n3.  **Define Set B:**\n\n    Set B is defined as {x | x \u2208 U and x is a prime number}. This means B contains all elements from U that are prime numbers.  Remember, a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has only two factors: 1 and itself. Therefore:\n\n    B = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}\n\n4.  **Determine A' (Complement of A):**\n\n    The complement of A (A') is the set of all elements in U that are *not* in A.\n\n    A' = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19}\n\n5.  **Determine B' (Complement of B):**\n\n    The complement of B (B') is the set of all elements in U that are *not* in B.\n\n    B' = {1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18}\n\n6.  **Determine A' \u2229 B' (Intersection of A' and B'):**\n\n    The intersection of A' and B' (A' \u2229 B') is the set of all elements that are *common* to both A' and B'.\n\n    A' \u2229 B' = {1, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16}\n\n**Final Answers:**\n\n*   A' = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19}\n*   B' = {1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18}\n*   A' \u2229 B' = {1, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16}\n",

They need to explicitly state the definitions and conditions they are using to arrive at their conclusion.  Simply saying \"they have the same numbers\" is not sufficient. Referencing the definition of set equality would strengthen the answer.\n*   **Formal Language:** Encourage the student to use more formal mathematical language.\n*   **Show All Work:** While not explicitly asked for in all parts, encourage the student to *show* how they arrived at their answers. This is especially helpful in questions involving set builder notation. The model answers do this.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   Review the definitions of set equality, subset, union, intersection, and complement.\n*   Practice writing explanations that clearly state the reasoning behind each step.\n*   When answering questions about sets, make sure to explicitly refer to the relevant definitions. For instance, when showing that two sets are equal, explicitly state that they contain exactly the same elements."
