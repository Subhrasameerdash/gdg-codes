        "student_answer": "1.  **A biased coin, where the probability of getting heads is twice the probability of getting tails, is tossed. If the result is heads, a ball is drawn from Bag A, which contains 3 red and 5 black balls. If the result is tails, a ball is drawn from Bag B, which contains 7 red and 1 black ball. If a red ball is drawn, what is the probability that the coin toss resulted in heads?** (This question tests Bayes' Theorem and understanding of conditional probability combined with a prior probability.)\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the provided assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student and based on the NCERT content.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet's break down this problem step-by-step using Bayes' Theorem and conditional probability.\n\n**1. Define the Events:**\n\n*   **H:** The event that the coin toss results in heads.\n*   **T:** The event that the coin toss results in tails.\n*   **R:** The event that a red ball is drawn.\n\n**2. Determine the Prior Probabilities:**\n\nWe are given that the probability of getting heads is twice the probability of getting tails.  Therefore:\n\n*   P(H) = 2 * P(T)\n\nSince H and T are the only possible outcomes of the coin toss, we know:\n\n*   P(H) + P(T) = 1\n\nSubstituting P(H) = 2 * P(T) into the equation:\n\n*   2 * P(T) + P(T) = 1\n*   3 * P(T) = 1\n*   P(T) = 1/3\n*   P(H) = 2 * (1/3) = 2/3\n\nSo, P(H) = 2/3 and P(T) = 1/3.\n\n**3. Determine the Conditional Probabilities:**\n\nWe need to find the probability of drawing a red ball *given* that we selected from Bag A (heads) or Bag B (tails).\n\n*   P(R|H): Probability of drawing a red ball, given heads was tossed (Bag A was chosen). Bag A contains 3 red and 5 black balls, so there are 8 balls in total.\n\n    *   P(R|H) = 3/8\n\n*   P(R|T): Probability of drawing a red ball, given tails was tossed (Bag B was chosen). Bag B contains 7 red and 1 black ball, so there are 8 balls in total.\n\n    *   P(R|T) = 7/8\n\n**4. State what we need to find:**\n\nWe want to find P(H|R):  The probability that heads was tossed, *given* that a red ball was drawn.\n\n**5. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**\n\nBayes' Theorem states:\n\nP(H|R) = [P(R|H) * P(H)] / P(R)\n\nWe have P(R|H) and P(H), but we need to find P(R). We can find P(R) using the law of total probability:\n\nP(R) = P(R|H) * P(H) + P(R|T) * P(T)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\nP(R) = (3/8) * (2/3) + (7/8) * (1/3)\nP(R) = (6/24) + (7/24)\nP(R) = 13/24\n\n**6. Substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:**\n\nP(H|R) = [(3/8) * (2/3)] / (13/24)\nP(H|R) = (6/24) / (13/24)\nP(H|R) = (6/24) * (24/13)\nP(H|R) = 6/13\n\n**Therefore, the probability that the coin toss resulted in heads, given that a red ball was drawn, is 6/13.**\n\n**Explanation for understanding:**\n\n*   **Prior Probability:**  The probabilities P(H) and P(T) are called *prior probabilities* because they represent our belief about the coin toss *before* we know anything about the ball that was drawn.\n*   **Conditional Probability:** The probabilities P(R|H) and P(R|T) are conditional probabilities because they depend on whether heads or tails was tossed.\n*   **Posterior Probability:** The probability P(H|R) is called a *posterior probability* because it represents our updated belief about the coin toss *after* we know that a red ball was drawn.  Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence.\n*   **Total Probability:** Calculating P(R) using the Law of Total Probability ensures that we are considering all the ways the event 'R' (drawing a red ball) can occur. It helps in normalizing the probabilities within Bayes' Theorem.\n\n2.  **Two events, X and Y, are associated with a random experiment. Given that P(X) = 0.5, determine the value of P(Y) if X and Y are independent and P(X\u222aY) = 0.8.** (This question tests the understanding of independence, union of events, and how to apply the formula P(X\u222aY) = P(X) + P(Y) - P(X\u2229Y).)\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the NCERT chapter content provided and your assignment question.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**Understanding the Concepts**\n\nBefore we solve the problem, let's recap the key concepts involved:\n\n*   **Independent Events:** Two events, X and Y, are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, this means P(X\u2229Y) = P(X) * P(Y).\n*   **Union of Events:** The union of two events, denoted by X\u222aY, is the event that either X occurs, Y occurs, or both occur.\n*   **Probability of Union:** The probability of the union of two events is given by the formula: P(X\u222aY) = P(X) + P(Y) - P(X\u2229Y).\n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\nWe are given:\n\n*   P(X) = 0.5\n*   P(X\u222aY) = 0.8\n*   X and Y are independent events.\n\nOur goal is to find P(Y).\n\nHere's how we can solve it step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Use the formula for the union of events:**\n\n    P(X\u222aY) = P(X) + P(Y) - P(X\u2229Y)\n\n2.  **Since X and Y are independent, we can substitute P(X\u2229Y) with P(X) * P(Y):**\n\n    P(X\u222aY) = P(X) + P(Y) - [P(X) * P(Y)]\n\n3.  **Now, plug in the given values:**\n\n    0.  8 = 0.5 + P(Y) - [0.5 * P(Y)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the equation:**\n\n    0.  8 = 0.5 + P(Y) - 0.5P(Y)\n    0.  8 - 0.5 = 0.5P(Y)\n    0.  3 = 0.5P(Y)\n\n5.  **Solve for P(Y):**\n\n    P(Y) = 0.3 / 0.5\n    P(Y) = 0.6\n\n**Therefore, the value of P(Y) is 0.6.**\n\n**Final Answer:** P(Y) = 0.6\n\n3.  **A quality control inspector selects two items at random, *without replacement*, from a batch of 20 items, of which 5 are defective. Let A be the event that the first item selected is defective and B be the event that the second item selected is defective. Are events A and B independent? Justify your answer using probability calculations.** (This question examines the concept of independence when sampling without replacement and requires students to show their work to explain why the events are or aren't independent.)\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student, based on the NCERT chapter summary provided, and addressing the question of independence with sampling without replacement.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo determine if events A and B are independent, we need to check if P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B).  If this condition holds true, then the events are independent. Otherwise, they are dependent.\n\n*   **Calculate P(A):**\n\n    P(A) is the probability that the first item selected is defective. There are 5 defective items out of a total of 20. Therefore:\n\n    P(A) = 5/20 = 1/4\n\n*   **Calculate P(B|A):**\n\n    P(B|A) is the probability that the second item is defective *given that* the first item selected was defective. After selecting one defective item, there are now 4 defective items left, and a total of 19 items remaining. Therefore:\n\n    P(B|A) = 4/19\n\n*   **Calculate P(A \u2229 B):**\n\n    P(A \u2229 B) is the probability that both the first and second items selected are defective. This is calculated as:\n\n    P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = (1/4) * (4/19) = 1/19\n\n*   **Calculate P(B):**\n\n    P(B) is the probability that the second item selected is defective.\n    We can consider two scenarios:\n        * The first item drawn is defective (A): P(A) = 5/20 and P(B|A) = 4/19\n        * The first item drawn is NOT defective (A'): P(A') = 15/20 and P(B|A') = 5/19\n\n    Therefore, P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(A') * P(B|A')\n    P(B) = (5/20) * (4/19) + (15/20) * (5/19) = 20/380 + 75/380 = 95/380 = 1/4\n\n*   **Check for Independence:**\n\n    Now, let's check if P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B):\n\n    P(A) * P(B) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\n    Since P(A \u2229 B) = 1/19 and P(A) * P(B) = 1/16, P(A \u2229 B) \u2260 P(A) * P(B)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBecause P(A \u2229 B) is not equal to P(A) * P(B), the events A and B are **not independent**. They are dependent events.  The outcome of the first selection *does* affect the probability of the outcome of the second selection because we are sampling without replacement.\n",
