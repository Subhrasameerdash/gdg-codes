        "student_answer": "1.  A hypothetical planet has twice the radius of Earth but the same average density.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided chapter content.\n\n**Question:** A hypothetical planet has twice the radius of Earth but the same average density.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo determine the relationship between the gravitational acceleration on the surface of this hypothetical planet compared to Earth, we need to consider how radius and density affect gravitational acceleration (g).\n\nRecall that the acceleration due to gravity on a planet's surface is given by:\n\ng = (G * M) / R\u00b2\n\nWhere:\n\n*   G is the gravitational constant\n*   M is the mass of the planet\n*   R is the radius of the planet\n\nWe are given that the hypothetical planet has twice the radius of Earth (R_planet = 2 * R_Earth) and the same average density (\u03c1_planet = \u03c1_Earth).  We need to relate mass (M) to density (\u03c1) and volume (V) using the formula:\n\nM = \u03c1 * V\n\nSince we're dealing with planets, we can assume they are spheres. The volume of a sphere is:\n\nV = (4/3) * \u03c0 * R\u00b3\n\nTherefore, the mass of a planet can be expressed as:\n\nM = \u03c1 * (4/3) * \u03c0 * R\u00b3\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for mass into the formula for gravitational acceleration:\n\ng = (G * (\u03c1 * (4/3) * \u03c0 * R\u00b3)) / R\u00b2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ng = (4/3) * G * \u03c0 * \u03c1 * R\n\nThis equation shows that gravitational acceleration (g) is directly proportional to the density (\u03c1) and the radius (R) of the planet.\n\nLet's denote the gravitational acceleration on Earth as g_Earth and on the hypothetical planet as g_planet. We can write the following equations:\n\ng_Earth = (4/3) * G * \u03c0 * \u03c1_Earth * R_Earth\n\ng_planet = (4/3) * G * \u03c0 * \u03c1_planet * R_planet\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of g_planet to g_Earth:\n\ng_planet / g_Earth = [(4/3) * G * \u03c0 * \u03c1_planet * R_planet] / [(4/3) * G * \u03c0 * \u03c1_Earth * R_Earth]\n\nSince (4/3), G, and \u03c0 are constants, they cancel out:\n\ng_planet / g_Earth = (\u03c1_planet * R_planet) / (\u03c1_Earth * R_Earth)\n\nWe are given that \u03c1_planet = \u03c1_Earth and R_planet = 2 * R_Earth. Substituting these values:\n\ng_planet / g_Earth = (\u03c1_Earth * (2 * R_Earth)) / (\u03c1_Earth * R_Earth)\n\n\u03c1_Earth cancels out:\n\ng_planet / g_Earth = (2 * R_Earth) / R_Earth\n\nR_Earth cancels out:\n\ng_planet / g_Earth = 2\n\nTherefore, g_planet = 2 * g_Earth\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the hypothetical planet is *twice* the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth.\n\n2.  Imagine a binary star system where two stars of unequal masses (m1 and m2, where m1 > m2) orbit each other.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's an answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the binary star system question, drawing upon the provided chapter information:\n\n**Question:** Imagine a binary star system where two stars of unequal masses (m1 and m2, where m1 > m2) orbit each other. Describe the key features of their motion, including the location of their center of mass, their orbital periods, and relative orbital speeds.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nIn a binary star system consisting of two stars with unequal masses (m1 and m2, where m1 > m2), several important characteristics define their motion:\n\n1.  **Center of Mass:**  The two stars do not orbit around a fixed point in space. Instead, they both orbit around their common *center of mass* (also known as the barycenter). The center of mass is the point where the system's mass is perfectly balanced. Since m1 > m2, the center of mass will be located *closer* to the more massive star (m1). Imagine a see-saw: to balance it, the heavier person needs to sit closer to the fulcrum (the center).  Similarly, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit around the center of mass.\n\n2.  **Orbital Periods:** A crucial point is that both stars in the binary system have the *same* orbital period (T). This means they both complete one full revolution around the center of mass in the same amount of time.  This is a consequence of the gravitational interaction and the fact that they are bound together as a system.  If one star had a significantly different period, the system would likely be unstable.\n\n3.  **Relative Orbital Speeds:**  While the periods are the same, the orbital speeds of the two stars are *different*. The less massive star (m2) has a larger orbit around the center of mass and, therefore, must move at a *higher* orbital speed (v2) to complete its orbit in the same time as the more massive star (m1) with its smaller, slower orbit (v1).\n\n    *   Mathematically, since  `v = 2\u03c0r / T`, and T is the same for both, the star with the larger orbital radius (r) will have the larger velocity (v). Because m2 is further from the center of mass, it has a larger orbital radius, and therefore a larger velocity.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nIn an unequal-mass binary star system:\n\n*   Both stars orbit their common center of mass.\n*   The center of mass is closer to the more massive star.\n*   Both stars have the *same* orbital period.\n*   The less massive star has a *higher* orbital speed because it travels a greater distance in the same amount of time.\n\n3.  A spacecraft is launched from Earth towards a distant planet.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student, addressing the scenario of a spacecraft launched from Earth towards a distant planet, based on the provided Gravitation chapter information.\n\n**Question:** A spacecraft is launched from Earth towards a distant planet. Discuss the key gravitational concepts that are relevant to this mission, including:\n\n*   Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and its role in the spacecraft's trajectory.\n*   The concept of escape velocity and how it applies to leaving Earth's gravitational field.\n*   Gravitational potential energy and how it changes during the spacecraft's journey.\n*   How the gravitational pull of the distant planet affects the spacecraft as it approaches.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLaunching a spacecraft to a distant planet involves careful consideration of several gravitational principles. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:\n\n1.  **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and Trajectory:**\n\n    *   **Explanation:** Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation (F = Gm1m2/r\u00b2) is the foundation for understanding the spacecraft's trajectory. This law dictates the gravitational force between the spacecraft and any celestial body (Earth, the target planet, the Sun, etc.).  The spacecraft's path is determined by the *net* gravitational force acting on it at any given moment.\n    *   **Application:** Initially, Earth's gravity is dominant. As the spacecraft moves further away, the gravitational force exerted by Earth decreases (inversely proportional to the square of the distance).  Mission control needs to precisely calculate and account for this changing force to plot the spacecraft's course. They also have to consider the gravitational influence of the Sun and other planets along the way, as these can subtly alter the trajectory. Corrective maneuvers are periodically performed by firing onboard thrusters to keep the spacecraft on its planned path. These maneuvers are carefully calculated using Newton's Law to ensure the changes in velocity are precise.\n\n2.  **Escape Velocity:**\n\n    *   **Explanation:** Escape velocity is the minimum speed an object needs to overcome a planet's gravitational pull and never return.  It's the speed at which the object's kinetic energy is equal to the magnitude of its gravitational potential energy.\n    *   **Application:** To escape Earth's gravity, the spacecraft must achieve Earth's escape velocity (approximately 11.2 km/s). The initial rocket launch provides the spacecraft with the necessary kinetic energy to reach this speed.  However, escape velocity isn't a one-time thing.  While the spacecraft initially needs this speed to break free, its velocity will continuously change due to the gravitational influences it encounters throughout its journey.\n\n3.  **Gravitational Potential Energy:**\n\n    *   **Explanation:** Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is the energy an object possesses due to its position within a gravitational field. It's considered negative, with zero potential energy defined at an infinite distance from the gravitational source.  As an object moves further away from a planet, its GPE becomes less negative (i.e., increases).\n    *   **Application:** As the spacecraft ascends from Earth, its gravitational potential energy increases (becomes less negative).  The kinetic energy provided by the launch is converted into GPE.  Conversely, as the spacecraft approaches the target planet, its GPE decreases (becomes more negative), and its kinetic energy increases, causing it to accelerate towards the planet. Mission planners consider these GPE changes when calculating fuel requirements and trajectory adjustments.\n\n4.  **Gravitational Pull of the Distant Planet:**\n\n    *   **Explanation:** As the spacecraft approaches the distant planet, the planet's gravitational influence becomes increasingly significant.\n    *   **Application:** The planet's gravity will begin to pull the spacecraft towards it, altering its trajectory. This gravitational pull can be used to the spacecraft's advantage in a maneuver called a \"gravitational slingshot\" or \"gravity assist.\" By carefully flying past the planet, the spacecraft can gain speed and change direction without using its own fuel.  However, precise calculations are crucial to ensure the spacecraft enters the planet's gravitational field at the correct angle and speed to achieve the desired outcome (orbit insertion, flyby, or landing). If the spacecraft is intended to orbit the planet, rockets must be fired to slow it down so that it can be captured in the orbit.\n\nIn summary, a successful interplanetary mission hinges on a thorough understanding and application of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, escape velocity, gravitational potential energy, and the gravitational dynamics of both the departure and destination planets, as well as other celestial bodies along the way. Precise calculations and continuous monitoring are essential to ensure the spacecraft reaches its target safely and efficiently.\n",

A line connecting a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times (planets move faster when closer to the Sun).\n    3.  The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit (larger orbits take longer).\n\n*   **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:** Every object attracts every other object with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.
