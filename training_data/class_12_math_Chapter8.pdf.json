Determine the area of each region.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a complete solution to the assignment question, tailored for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:\n\n**Question 1: Area Partitioning**\n\nA curve defined by *y = \u221ax* divides the area of the rectangle with vertices (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), and (0,2) into two regions. Determine the area of each region.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Visualize the Problem:**\n\n   Imagine a rectangle with corners at the origin (0,0), (4,0), (4,2), and (0,2). The curve *y = \u221ax* starts at the origin and curves upwards as *x* increases. This curve cuts the rectangle into two distinct areas. Our goal is to find the area of each of these two regions.\n\n2. **Area of the Rectangle:**\n\n   The area of the rectangle is simply its length times its width:\n\n   Area of rectangle = (4 - 0) * (2 - 0) = 4 * 2 = 8 square units.\n\n3. **Area of Region 1 (Under the Curve):**\n\n   This is the area bounded by the curve *y = \u221ax*, the x-axis, and the vertical lines *x = 0* and *x = 4*. We can find this area using integration:\n\n   Area 1 = \u222b[from 0 to 4] *\u221ax dx*  = \u222b[from 0 to 4] *x<sup>1/2</sup> dx*\n\n   Now, let's evaluate the integral:\n\n   * The antiderivative of *x<sup>1/2</sup>* is (2/3) * x<sup>3/2</sup>\n   * Evaluate the antiderivative at the limits:\n      * At *x = 4*: (2/3) * (4)<sup>3/2</sup> = (2/3) * (2<sup>2</sup>)<sup>3/2</sup> = (2/3) * 2<sup>3</sup> = (2/3) * 8 = 16/3\n      * At *x = 0*: (2/3) * (0)<sup>3/2</sup> = 0\n\n   Area 1 = (16/3) - 0 = 16/3 square units.\n\n4. **Area of Region 2 (Above the Curve):**\n\n   We know that the area of the entire rectangle is 8 square units. Region 1 (the area under the curve) is 16/3 square units.  Therefore, Region 2 (the area above the curve) is the difference between the rectangle's area and Region 1's area:\n\n   Area 2 = Area of rectangle - Area 1\n   Area 2 = 8 - (16/3)\n   Area 2 = (24/3) - (16/3)\n   Area 2 = 8/3 square units.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n*   The area of the region under the curve *y = \u221ax* (Region 1) is **16/3 square units**.\n*   The area of the region above the curve *y = \u221ax* (Region 2) is **8/3 square units**.\n\n**Important Notes for Students:**\n\n*   **Visualization is Key:** Always try to sketch the graph. It helps you understand what you're calculating.\n*   **Understanding the Integral:** Remember that the definite integral represents the area under a curve.\n*   **Check your work:** Does the sum of the two areas equal the area of the rectangle? (16/3 + 8/3 = 24/3 = 8. Yes!) This helps verify your answer.\n*   **Units:** Always include the units (square units) when expressing area.\n*   **Alternative Method for Area 2:** You *could* also calculate Area 2 by integrating with respect to *y*.  You would need to express *x* as a function of *y* (i.e., *x = y<sup>2</sup>*) and integrate from *y = 0* to *y = 2*, and then subtract from *4*2. The rectangle would become 4*2 as x goes from 0 to 4 and y goes from 0 to 2.\nThe integral would then be int(4 dy -y^2 dy) from 0 to 2 and you would get the same value as calculated above of 8/3.\n\n2.  **Curve Intersection:** Find the area of the region enclosed between the parabola *y\u00b2 = 4x* and the line *y = x*.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a sample answer to the assignment question, suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student:\n\n**Question:** Find the area of the region enclosed between the parabola *y\u00b2 = 4x* and the line *y = x*.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo find the area of the region enclosed between the parabola *y\u00b2 = 4x* and the line *y = x*, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find the points of intersection:**  We need to determine where the parabola and the line intersect.  To do this, we solve the equations simultaneously.  Since *y = x*, we can substitute *x* for *y* in the equation of the parabola:\n\n    *   *x\u00b2 = 4x*\n    *   *x\u00b2 - 4x = 0*\n    *   *x(x - 4) = 0*\n\n    This gives us two solutions for *x*:  *x = 0* and *x = 4*.  Now we find the corresponding *y* values using *y = x*:\n\n    *   When *x = 0*, *y = 0*.  So, the point of intersection is (0, 0).\n    *   When *x = 4*, *y = 4*.  So, the point of intersection is (4, 4).\n\n    Therefore, the parabola and the line intersect at the points (0, 0) and (4, 4).\n\n2.  **Express *x* in terms of *y*:**  Since the parabola is given as *y\u00b2 = 4x*, we can rewrite it as *x = y\u00b2/4*. The line is already in terms of y,  *x = y*.\n\n3.  **Set up the integral:**  We will integrate with respect to *y*.  The limits of integration will be the *y*-coordinates of the points of intersection, which are 0 and 4.  We need to integrate the difference between the *x*-values of the two curves.  Since the line *x = y* is to the right of the parabola *x = y\u00b2/4* in the region of interest, we subtract the parabola's *x*-value from the line's *x*-value:\n\n    Area = \u222b\\[0 to 4] *(y - y\u00b2/4) dy*\n\n4.  **Evaluate the integral:**\n\n    *   Find the antiderivative of *(y - y\u00b2/4)*:  *(y\u00b2/2) - (y\u00b3/12)*\n    *   Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper and lower limits of integration:\n        *   At *y = 4*:  (4\u00b2/2) - (4\u00b3/12) = (16/2) - (64/12) = 8 - 16/3 = 24/3 - 16/3 = 8/3\n        *   At *y = 0*:  (0\u00b2/2) - (0\u00b3/12) = 0\n\n5.  **Subtract the values:**\n\n    Area = (8/3) - 0 = 8/3\n\n**Answer:** The area of the region enclosed between the parabola *y\u00b2 = 4x* and the line *y = x* is 8/3 square units.\n\n**Explanation of Key Steps:**\n\n*   **Finding Intersection Points:** Crucial to determine the integration limits.\n*   **Expressing *x* in terms of *y*:** This choice simplifies the integration as the region is more easily defined by horizontal strips in this case.\n*   **Setting up the Correct Integral:**  Subtract the *x*-value of the \"left\" curve from the *x*-value of the \"right\" curve when integrating with respect to *y*.  Visualizing the region helps determine which curve is on the right.  Always remember to use the proper limits of integration!\n*   **Units:**  Remember to include \"square units\" in your final answer when calculating area.\n\n3.  **Area with Absolute Value:** Calculate the area of the region bounded by the curve *y = |x - 1|*, the x-axis, and the lines *x = -1* and *x = 2*.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer to the assignment question, tailored for CBSE Class 11-12 students, based on the provided chapter content and my earlier detailed elaboration:\n\n**Question:** Calculate the area of the region bounded by the curve *y = |x - 1|*, the x-axis, and the lines *x = -1* and *x = 2*.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo find the area bounded by *y = |x - 1|*, the x-axis, and the lines *x = -1* and *x = 2*, we need to consider the absolute value function. The absolute value function changes its behavior at *x = 1*. Therefore, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\n**1. Understanding the Absolute Value Function:**\n\nThe function *y = |x - 1|* can be defined piecewise as follows:\n\n*   *y = -(x - 1) = 1 - x*,  when *x < 1*\n*   *y = (x - 1)*, when *x \u2265 1*\n\nThis means that to the left of *x = 1*, the graph is a line with a negative slope, and to the right of *x = 1*, it's a line with a positive slope. The vertex (or corner) of the 'V' shape is at *(1, 0)*.\n\n**2. Splitting the Integral:**\n\nSince the function's definition changes at *x = 1*, we split the area calculation into two integrals:\n\n*   **Area 1:**  The area between *x = -1* and *x = 1*.  In this region, *y = 1 - x*.\n*   **Area 2:** The area between *x = 1* and *x = 2*.  In this region, *y = x - 1*.\n\n**3. Setting up the Integrals:**\n\n*   **Area 1:**  \u222b\\[-1 to 1] *(1 - x) dx*\n*   **Area 2:**  \u222b\\[1 to 2] *(x - 1) dx*\n\n**4. Evaluating the Integrals:**\n\n*   **Area 1:**\n    *   Find the antiderivative of *(1 - x)*:  *x - (x\u00b2/2)*\n    *   Evaluate at *x = 1*:  *(1 - (1\u00b2/2)) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2*\n    *   Evaluate at *x = -1*: *(-1 - ((-1)\u00b2/2)) = -1 - 1/2 = -3/2*\n    *   Subtract: *(1/2) - (-3/2) = 1/2 + 3/2 = 4/2 = 2*\n\n*   **Area 2:**\n    *   Find the antiderivative of *(x - 1)*: *(x\u00b2/2) - x*\n    *   Evaluate at *x = 2*: *((2\u00b2)/2 - 2) = 4/2 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0*\n    *   Evaluate at *x = 1*: *((1\u00b2)/2 - 1) = 1/2 - 1 = -1/2*\n    *   Subtract: *0 - (-1/2) = 1/2*\n\n**5. Adding the Areas:**\n\nThe total area is the sum of Area 1 and Area 2:\n\nTotal Area = Area 1 + Area 2 = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2\n\n**Answer:**  The area of the region bounded by the curve *y = |x - 1|*, the x-axis, and the lines *x = -1* and *x = 2* is 5/2 square units.\n\n**Key Points for Class 11-12 Students:**\n\n*   **Absolute Value Functions:**  Remember to split the integral at the point where the expression inside the absolute value changes sign.\n*   **Visualizing the Area:**  A quick sketch of the graph can really help you understand the problem and ensure you're setting up the integrals correctly.\n*   **Careful Evaluation:**  Pay close attention to the signs when evaluating the antiderivatives at the limits of integration.\n*   **Units:** Always include the units (square units) in your final answer when calculating area.\n",
        "model_answer": "### Summary ###\n\u00ae The area of the region bounded by the curve y = f (x), x-axis and the lines\n\n### Definitions ###\nOkay, here's educational content based on the provided NCERT chapter extract, focusing on explaining the concepts in my own words and creating a new solved example:\n\n**Chapter 8: Application of Integrals - Definitions and Concepts**\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis chapter explores how definite integrals can be used to calculate areas of regions bounded by curves, lines, and the axes. It builds upon the understanding of definite integrals as the limit of a sum (from the previous chapter). We'll learn how to find the area under simple curves, between curves, and within shapes like circles, parabolas, and ellipses. The core idea is to divide the area into infinitely small strips, calculate the area of each strip using integration, and then add them up to find the total area.\n\n**Key Definitions and Concepts:**\n\n*   **Area Under a Curve:** Imagine a curve *y = f(x)* plotted on a graph. The area \"under\" the curve between two vertical lines *x = a* and *x = b*, and above the x-axis, can be found using a definite integral. This is like summing up the areas of many tiny rectangles squeezed between the curve and the x-axis. The formula is:\n\n    Area = \u222b\\[a to b] *f(x) dx*\n\n*   **Elementary Area:** This refers to the area of one of those infinitely thin rectangles mentioned above. It's represented as *dA = y dx* (or *dA = x dy* if we're using horizontal strips).\n\n*   **Area Bounded by a Curve and the Y-axis:** If the area is bounded by a curve *x = g(y)*, the y-axis, and two horizontal lines *y = c* and *y = d*, we integrate with respect to *y*:\n\n    Area = \u222b\\[c to d] *g(y) dy*\n\n*   **Area When the Curve is Below the X-axis:** If a portion of the curve lies below the x-axis, the integral will give a negative value. Remember that area is always positive, so we take the absolute value of the integral for that portion.\n\n*   **Area of Complex Shapes:** When a curve crosses the x-axis, dividing the area into separate parts above and below the axis, we need to calculate the area of each part separately (taking the absolute value for the parts below the x-axis) and then add them together.\n\n**Solved Example:**\n\n**Problem:** Find the area of the region bounded by the curve *y = x\u00b2 + 1*, the x-axis, and the lines *x = 0* and *x = 2*.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Sketch the curve:** (Not required, but helps visualize) The curve *y = x\u00b2 + 1* is a parabola shifted one unit upwards.\n\n2.  **Set up the integral:** Since we want the area bounded by *y = x\u00b2 + 1*, the x-axis, and the vertical lines *x = 0* and *x = 2*, we integrate the function *f(x) = x\u00b2 + 1* from 0 to 2:\n\n    Area = \u222b\\[0 to 2] *(x\u00b2 + 1) dx*\n\n3.  **Evaluate the integral:**\n    *   Find the antiderivative of *x\u00b2 + 1*:  (x\u00b3/3) + x\n    *   Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper and lower limits of integration:\n        *   At *x = 2*: (2\u00b3/3) + 2 = 8/3 + 2 = 14/3\n        *   At *x = 0*: (0\u00b3/3) + 0 = 0\n\n4.  **Subtract the values:**\n    Area = (14/3) - 0 = 14/3\n\n**Answer:** The area of the region is 14/3 square units.\n\n### Solved Examples ###\nFind the area enclosed by the circle x2 + y2 = a2.\nFind the area enclosed by the ellipse \n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\nFind the area of the region bounded by the line y = 3x + 2, the x-axis and\nFind the area bounded by\n\n### Exercises ###\n8.1\n1.\non Chapter 8\n1.\n\n"
