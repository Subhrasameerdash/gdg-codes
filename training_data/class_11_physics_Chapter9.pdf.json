        "student_answer": "1.  A hydraulic lift uses compressed air to exert force on a smaller piston, which then transmits the force to a larger piston to lift a car. If the diameters of the two pistons are in the ratio 1:5, and the car has a mass of 1500 kg, calculate the air pressure required to lift the car, neglecting friction. Explain briefly how the principle of \"force per unit area\" is crucial in the operation of such a lift.\nSample Answer:\nHere's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll use Pascal's principle, which is the basis for the operation of a hydraulic lift. Pascal's principle states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid. The principle of \"force per unit area\" is crucial here, as it defines pressure and allows us to relate the forces applied to the different sized pistons.\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. **Given Information:**\n   *  Ratio of diameters of the pistons: d\u2081/d\u2082 = 1/5\n   *  Mass of the car (m): 1500 kg\n   *  Acceleration due to gravity (g): approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2\n\n2. **Calculate the Force required to lift the car (F\u2082):**\n   * F\u2082 = m * g = 1500 kg * 9.8 m/s\u00b2 = 14700 N\n\n3. **Relationship between Diameters and Areas:**\n   * Since the area of a circle (piston) is proportional to the square of the diameter (A = \u03c0(d/2)\u00b2), the ratio of the areas of the two pistons is the square of the ratio of their diameters:\n      * A\u2081/A\u2082 = (d\u2081/d\u2082)\u00b2 = (1/5)\u00b2 = 1/25\n   * Therefore, A\u2082 = 25 * A\u2081\n\n4. **Applying Pascal's Principle:**\n    * The pressure on the smaller piston (P\u2081) must be equal to the pressure on the larger piston (P\u2082):\n       * P\u2081 = P\u2082\n    * Since Pressure (P) = Force (F) / Area (A), we have:\n       * F\u2081/A\u2081 = F\u2082/A\u2082\n\n5. **Calculate the Force on the smaller piston (F\u2081):**\n    * We know F\u2082 = 14700 N and A\u2082 = 25 * A\u2081. Substituting these values into the equation F\u2081/A\u2081 = F\u2082/A\u2082:\n       * F\u2081/A\u2081 = 14700 N / (25 * A\u2081)\n       * F\u2081 = 14700 N / 25 = 588 N\n\n6. **Calculate the Air Pressure (P\u2081):**\n    * We need to find the pressure required on the smaller piston (P\u2081).  To calculate the pressure we would ideally divide the force (F\u2081) by the area (A\u2081). Since the area of the first piston (A\u2081) is not provided, we will keep it in the expression.\n    * P\u2081 = F\u2081 / A\u2081 = 588 N / A\u2081\n\n7.  **Understanding A\u2081:**\n    * While we could substitute A\u2081 = \u03c0(d\u2081/2)\u00b2 and choose an arbitrary diameter (d\u2081) we are not required to do so, as that would only return a single valid pressure for that single chosen diameter.\n\nTherefore, the air pressure required is dependent on the area of the smaller piston A\u2081. As the force exerted on the smaller piston will be applied via air compression, that will be equal to the pressure from the compressed air required.\n\n**Explanation of \"Force per Unit Area\" in Hydraulic Lifts:**\n\nThe principle of \"force per unit area\" (pressure) is fundamental to how hydraulic lifts work. Because pressure is transmitted equally throughout the fluid, a small force applied over a small area (the smaller piston) creates a pressure. This same pressure acts on the larger area of the larger piston.  Since Pressure = Force/Area, and the pressure is constant, a larger area will experience a proportionally larger force. This allows the hydraulic lift to multiply the input force, enabling it to lift heavy objects like cars. Without the concept of pressure, we wouldn't be able to effectively transmit and amplify force using fluids in this manner.\n\n2.  Imagine a scenario where you are designing a deep-sea research submersible. Discuss how Bernoulli's principle and the concept of pressure variation with depth would be critical in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the submersible at a depth of 500 meters. Specifically, address the measures you would take to counteract the increasing pressure at greater depths and maintain a stable flow of fluids within the submersible's systems. (Assume the density of seawater is 1025 kg/m3)\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT content, addressing the deep-sea submersible design question.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nDesigning a deep-sea research submersible requires a thorough understanding of fluid mechanics, particularly Bernoulli's principle and pressure variation with depth. These principles are critical for ensuring the submersible's structural integrity and the proper functioning of its internal systems at significant depths, such as 500 meters.\n\n**Pressure Variation with Depth:**\n\nThe pressure at a depth 'h' in a fluid is given by:\n\nP = P\u2080 + \u03c1gh\n\nWhere:\n\n*   P is the absolute pressure at depth 'h'\n*   P\u2080 is the atmospheric pressure at the surface (approximately 1.013 x 10\u2075 Pa)\n*   \u03c1 is the density of the fluid (seawater in this case, given as 1025 kg/m\u00b3)\n*   g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2)\n*   h is the depth (500 m in this case)\n\nTherefore, at a depth of 500 meters:\n\nP = 1.013 x 10\u2075 Pa + (1025 kg/m\u00b3)(9.8 m/s\u00b2)(500 m)\nP \u2248 1.013 x 10\u2075 Pa + 5.02 x 10\u2076 Pa\nP \u2248 5.12 x 10\u2076 Pa (or 51.2 atmospheres)\n\nThis calculation shows that the submersible will experience an immense pressure of approximately 51.2 atmospheres at 500 meters.\n\n**Measures to Counteract Pressure:**\n\n1.  **Structural Integrity:** The submersible's hull must be designed to withstand this enormous pressure. This involves:\n\n    *   **Shape:** Spherical or cylindrical shapes are optimal for pressure resistance, as they distribute stress evenly.\n    *   **Material:** High-strength materials like titanium alloys are essential. Titanium has a high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance, making it ideal for deep-sea applications. The thickness of the hull must be carefully calculated based on the yield strength of the chosen material and the maximum operating depth.\n    *   **Reinforcement:** Ribs and stiffeners can be incorporated into the hull design to further enhance its resistance to compression.\n\n2.  **Pressure Compensation:**\n\n    *   **Oil-Filled Compartments:** Critical components within the submersible, such as electronics and batteries, are often housed in oil-filled compartments. The oil is incompressible and transmits pressure evenly, preventing damage to the sensitive components. The pressure inside these compartments must be equalized to the external pressure to avoid implosion or crushing.\n    *   **Pressure Vessels:** Some components might be housed within individual pressure vessels designed to withstand the external pressure. These vessels need to be incredibly strong and sealed effectively.\n\n**Bernoulli's Principle and Fluid System Stability:**\n\nBernoulli's principle states that for an incompressible, non-viscous fluid, an increase in fluid speed occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. While the submersible won't experience high-speed external flow, Bernoulli's principle is crucial for internal fluid systems, such as:\n\n1.  **Hydraulic Systems:**  The submersible likely uses hydraulic systems for various functions like controlling robotic arms, adjusting ballast, and maneuvering. The design of these systems must account for:\n\n    *   **Consistent Flow Rates:**  Pipes and valves should be sized to maintain consistent fluid flow rates, preventing pressure drops that could affect system performance. Bernoulli's principle reminds us that constricting flow areas increases velocity and decreases pressure.\n    *   **Cavitation Prevention:**  Sharp bends or restrictions in hydraulic lines can cause localized pressure drops, potentially leading to cavitation (formation of vapor bubbles). Cavitation can damage components and reduce system efficiency. Smooth, streamlined designs minimize this risk.\n\n2.  **Ballast System:** The ballast system controls the submersible's buoyancy. Proper operation depends on:\n\n    *   **Controlled Flow:** Pumping water into or out of ballast tanks must be carefully controlled to achieve desired ascent or descent rates. Understanding fluid flow and pressure is essential for designing an effective ballast system. Bernoulli's principle can help predict the pressure changes needed for efficient pumping.\n\n3.  **Life Support System:** The life support system maintains a breathable atmosphere and removes carbon dioxide. It relies on circulating air.\n\n    *   **Even air circulation:** The airflow must be steady and even to make sure all members of the research team get an adequate oxygen supply and to ensure CO2 doesn't build up.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe successful design and operation of a deep-sea research submersible at 500 meters depends heavily on a comprehensive understanding of pressure variation with depth and the application of Bernoulli's principle. By carefully considering structural integrity, implementing pressure compensation techniques, and optimizing internal fluid systems, we can build a safe and effective vehicle for exploring the deep ocean.\n\n3.  A small metal sphere is dropped into a viscous liquid. Describe the various forces acting on the sphere as it falls through the liquid. Explain how these forces contribute to the sphere eventually reaching its terminal velocity. Discuss how the size and density of the sphere, as well as the viscosity of the liquid, influence the magnitude of this terminal velocity.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content. It aims for clarity, conciseness, and completeness:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nWhen a small metal sphere is dropped into a viscous liquid, several forces act on it, influencing its motion. These forces are:\n\n1.  **Weight (W):** This is the force due to gravity acting downwards. It's given by *W = mg*, where *m* is the mass of the sphere and *g* is the acceleration due to gravity.  Since *m = V\u03c1*, where *V* is the volume of the sphere and *\u03c1* is its density, we can also write *W = V\u03c1g*.  A denser sphere will have a larger weight.\n\n2.  **Buoyant Force (Upthrust, U):**  This is an upward force exerted by the liquid on the sphere. According to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the sphere.  Therefore, *U = V\u03c1<sub>L</sub>g*, where *\u03c1<sub>L</sub>* is the density of the liquid and *V* is the volume of the sphere (which is equal to the volume of the liquid displaced).\n\n3.  **Viscous Drag Force (F<sub>v</sub>):** This is a retarding force acting upwards, opposing the motion of the sphere through the liquid. The magnitude of this force depends on the velocity of the sphere, the viscosity of the liquid, and the size (radius) of the sphere. According to Stokes' Law (not explicitly mentioned in your excerpt but crucial for this explanation), for a spherical object moving slowly through a viscous fluid, the viscous force is given by *F<sub>v</sub> = 6\u03c0\u03b7rv*, where *\u03b7* is the coefficient of viscosity of the liquid, *r* is the radius of the sphere, and *v* is the instantaneous velocity of the sphere.\n\n**How these forces lead to Terminal Velocity:**\n\nInitially, when the sphere is dropped, its velocity is zero.  The weight (W) is acting downwards, and the buoyant force (U) and viscous force (F<sub>v</sub>) are acting upwards.  Since the velocity is low initially, the viscous force is small.  Therefore, the net downward force (W - U - F<sub>v</sub>) is significant, and the sphere accelerates downwards.\n\nAs the sphere's velocity increases, the viscous drag force (F<sub>v</sub> = 6\u03c0\u03b7rv) also increases proportionally.  This reduces the net downward force and consequently, the acceleration decreases.\n\nEventually, the sphere reaches a point where the upward forces (buoyant force *U* and viscous drag force *F<sub>v</sub>*) are exactly equal to the downward force (weight *W*). At this point, the net force on the sphere becomes zero, and its acceleration becomes zero. The sphere then falls with a constant velocity, known as the **terminal velocity (v<sub>t</sub>)**.\n\nMathematically, at terminal velocity:\n\nW = U + F<sub>v</sub>\nV\u03c1g = V\u03c1<sub>L</sub>g + 6\u03c0\u03b7rv<sub>t</sub>\n\nSolving for v<sub>t</sub>:\n\nv<sub>t</sub> = (V\u03c1g - V\u03c1<sub>L</sub>g) / (6\u03c0\u03b7r)\nv<sub>t</sub> = [V(\u03c1 - \u03c1<sub>L</sub>)g] / (6\u03c0\u03b7r)\n\nSince V = (4/3)\u03c0r<sup>3</sup>:\n\nv<sub>t</sub> = [ (4/3)\u03c0r<sup>3</sup> (\u03c1 - \u03c1<sub>L</sub>)g ] / (6\u03c0\u03b7r)\nv<sub>t</sub> = [2r<sup>2</sup>(\u03c1 - \u03c1<sub>L</sub>)g] / (9\u03b7)\n\n**Influence of Size, Density, and Viscosity on Terminal Velocity:**\n\nFrom the derived equation for terminal velocity, v<sub>t</sub> = [2r<sup>2</sup>(\u03c1 - \u03c1<sub>L</sub>)g] / (9\u03b7), we can see the following:\n\n*   **Size (Radius, r):** The terminal velocity is directly proportional to the square of the radius of the sphere (v<sub>t</sub> \u221d r<sup>2</sup>). This means that a larger sphere will have a significantly higher terminal velocity than a smaller sphere (assuming all other factors remain constant).\n\n*   **Density (\u03c1 of the sphere):** The terminal velocity is directly proportional to the difference between the density of the sphere (\u03c1) and the density of the liquid (\u03c1<sub>L</sub>) (v<sub>t</sub> \u221d (\u03c1 - \u03c1<sub>L</sub>)). A denser sphere (compared to the liquid) will have a higher terminal velocity. If the sphere is less dense than the liquid (\u03c1 < \u03c1<sub>L</sub>), the terminal velocity will be negative, implying the sphere will float upwards.\n\n*   **Viscosity (\u03b7 of the liquid):** The terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the liquid (v<sub>t</sub> \u221d 1/\u03b7). A more viscous liquid will result in a lower terminal velocity because it offers greater resistance to the sphere's motion.\n\nIn summary, the interplay between weight, buoyant force, and viscous drag determines the motion of a sphere in a viscous liquid.  The sphere accelerates until the viscous drag and buoyant force balance the weight, at which point it reaches its terminal velocity. The terminal velocity is strongly influenced by the sphere's size and density, as well as the viscosity of the liquid.\n",
