        "student_answer": "1.  Explain, using a specific example, why the existence of a limit of a function at a point does not necessarily imply the function is defined at that point. Furthermore, describe a scenario where the limit exists but the function is discontinuous.\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe existence of a limit of a function *f(x)* as *x* approaches a point *a* means that the values of *f(x)* get arbitrarily close to a specific value *L* as *x* gets arbitrarily close to *a*, *without necessarily requiring f(a)* to be defined or equal to *L*.\n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider the function:\n\nf(x) = (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2)  for x \u2260 2\n\nand f(x) is undefined at x=2\n\nNotice that *f(2)* is undefined because it would result in division by zero.  However, we can find the limit of *f(x)* as *x* approaches 2:\n\nlim (x\u21922) (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2) = lim (x\u21922) (x - 2)(x + 2) / (x - 2) = lim (x\u21922) (x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, lim (x\u21922) f(x) = 4, even though *f(2)* is undefined.  This demonstrates that the limit can exist even if the function is not defined at that particular point.\n\n**Scenario with a Limit and Discontinuity:**\n\nNow, let's describe a scenario where the limit exists, but the function is discontinuous:\n\nConsider a function g(x) defined as follows:\n\ng(x) = (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2)  for x \u2260 2\ng(2) = 1\n\nFrom our previous example, we know that lim (x\u21922) g(x) = 4.  However, *g(2) = 1*.  Since the limit as *x* approaches 2 (which is 4) is *not equal* to the value of the function at 2 (which is 1), the function *g(x)* is discontinuous at *x = 2*.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe example illustrates that the limit describes the behavior of the function *near* a point, not necessarily *at* the point.  The discontinuity arises because, even though the limit exists, the function value at that point is different from the limit.  Therefore, a limit existing at a point does not guarantee that the function is defined at that point, nor does it guarantee that the function is continuous at that point.\n\n2.  Suppose you are given two differentiable functions, f(x) and g(x), and a constant 'c'. Using only the definition of the derivative and the algebra of limits, prove the product rule:  d/dx [f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x).\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, based on the provided NCERT chapter content:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo prove the product rule, d/dx [f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x), we will use the definition of the derivative and the algebra of limits.\n\nRecall the definition of the derivative:\n\nf'(x) = lim (h\u21920) [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the product f(x)g(x) using this definition:\n\nd/dx [f(x)g(x)] = lim (h\u21920) [f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x)] / h\n\nOur goal is to manipulate this expression to get it in terms of f'(x) and g'(x).  To do this, we'll add and subtract a strategically chosen term in the numerator:  f(x + h)g(x). This allows us to separate the expression into manageable parts.\n\nd/dx [f(x)g(x)] = lim (h\u21920) [f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x + h)g(x) + f(x + h)g(x) - f(x)g(x)] / h\n\nNow, we can rearrange the terms and factor:\n\nd/dx [f(x)g(x)] = lim (h\u21920) [f(x + h){g(x + h) - g(x)} + g(x){f(x + h) - f(x)}] / h\n\nNext, we split the limit using the limit laws (specifically, the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, and the limit of a product is the product of the limits, assuming the individual limits exist):\n\nd/dx [f(x)g(x)] = lim (h\u21920) [f(x + h){g(x + h) - g(x)} / h] + lim (h\u21920) [g(x){f(x + h) - f(x)} / h]\n\nd/dx [f(x)g(x)] = lim (h\u21920) f(x + h) * lim (h\u21920) [g(x + h) - g(x)] / h  +  lim (h\u21920) g(x) * lim (h\u21920) [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h\n\nNow, we recognize the limits that define f'(x) and g'(x):\n\n*   lim (h\u21920) [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h = f'(x)\n*   lim (h\u21920) [g(x + h) - g(x)] / h = g'(x)\n\nAlso, since f(x) is differentiable, it is continuous.  Therefore, as h approaches 0, f(x + h) approaches f(x):\n\n*   lim (h\u21920) f(x + h) = f(x)\n\nFinally, g(x) does not depend on h, so\n\n*   lim (h\u21920) g(x) = g(x)\n\nSubstituting these limits back into our equation, we get:\n\nd/dx [f(x)g(x)] = f(x) * g'(x) + g(x) * f'(x)\n\nTherefore,\n\nd/dx [f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)\n\nThis completes the proof of the product rule.\n\n**Explanation of Key Steps:**\n\n*   **Starting with the Definition:** The solution starts with the fundamental definition of the derivative. This grounds the proof in first principles.\n*   **Adding and Subtracting a Term:** The step of adding and subtracting `f(x + h)g(x)` is crucial. It allows the separation of the original expression into terms that resemble the definitions of f'(x) and g'(x).  This is a common technique in calculus proofs.\n*   **Using Limit Laws:** The solution explicitly uses the limit laws (sum and product rules for limits) to break down the complex limit into simpler ones. This is important for justifying each step.\n*   **Recognizing Derivatives:** The solution clearly identifies the limits that correspond to f'(x) and g'(x).\n*   **Using Continuity:** Since differentiability implies continuity, the solution uses the fact that lim (h\u21920) f(x + h) = f(x) to simplify the expression. This step needs to be explicitly stated.\n*   **Clear Conclusion:** The final result is clearly stated, concluding the proof.\n\n3.  Consider the function f(x) = |x|. While this function is continuous everywhere, it is not differentiable at x=0. Using the first principle of derivatives, demonstrate why f'(0) does not exist. What does this imply about the relationship between continuity and differentiability?\nSample Answer:\nOkay, here's a sample answer suitable for a CBSE Class 11-12 student, addressing the given question using the provided NCERT chapter content:\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLet's analyze the function f(x) = |x| using the first principle of derivatives to understand why it's not differentiable at x = 0. The first principle defines the derivative as:\n\nf'(x) = lim (h->0) [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h\n\nTo find f'(0), we substitute x = 0:\n\nf'(0) = lim (h->0) [f(0 + h) - f(0)] / h  =  lim (h->0) [|h| - |0|] / h = lim (h->0) |h| / h\n\nNow, we need to consider the limit from both the left and the right:\n\n*   **Right-hand limit (h -> 0+):**  As 'h' approaches 0 from the positive side, |h| = h.  Therefore:\n\n    lim (h->0+) |h| / h = lim (h->0+) h / h = lim (h->0+) 1 = 1\n\n*   **Left-hand limit (h -> 0-):** As 'h' approaches 0 from the negative side, |h| = -h. Therefore:\n\n    lim (h->0-) |h| / h = lim (h->0-) -h / h = lim (h->0-) -1 = -1\n\nSince the right-hand limit (1) and the left-hand limit (-1) are not equal, the limit  lim (h->0) |h| / h does not exist.\n\nTherefore, f'(0) does not exist for f(x) = |x|.\n\n**Implication on Continuity and Differentiability:**\n\nThe fact that f(x) = |x| is continuous at x = 0 but not differentiable there illustrates an important point:\n\n*   **Differentiability implies continuity, but continuity does not imply differentiability.**\n\nIn other words, if a function is differentiable at a point, it *must* be continuous at that point. However, a function can be continuous at a point without being differentiable there. f(x) = |x| at x=0 is a classic example. The \"sharp corner\" or \"cusp\" in the graph of |x| at x = 0 visually represents this non-differentiability.  The function changes direction abruptly, meaning the slope (derivative) is undefined at that precise point.  For a function to be differentiable, it needs to be \"smooth\" at that point (no sharp turns or vertical tangents).\n",
