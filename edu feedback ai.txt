✅ Everything That Has Been Done
🔥 1. Project Setup and Preparation
✅ Installed all required dependencies:

PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face transformers.
Google Cloud SDK, Flask, and other required libraries.
✅ Set up Google Cloud:

Created a Google Cloud Project.
Enabled necessary APIs (Cloud Functions, Cloud Build, Cloud Run).
Configured authentication and billing.
Deployed the model as a REST API on Google Cloud Functions.
✅ Local Environment Setup:

Configured Anaconda environment with Jupyter Lab.
Installed all Python packages required for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
📚 2. Dataset Preparation
✅ Extracted text from NCERT textbooks using Tesseract OCR and stored them in a structured folder hierarchy:

ncert_model_answers/
teacher_assignments/
student_submissions/
grading_reports/
✅ Used Google Gemini to generate:

10 short questions (2 marks)
10 focused questions (5 marks)
3 long questions (10 marks)
For each subject in every class.
✅ Generated:

Teacher assignments with questions.
Student sample answers.
Grading reports with feedback.
✅ Combined all structured data into:

Training dataset (training_dataset.json).
Test dataset (test_dataset.json).
Dataset split in 80/20 ratio for training and testing.
✅ Verified the dataset structure:

Input: student_answer + model_answer.
Output: score, grade, and feedback.
🔥 3. Model Development
✅ Chose BERT-based custom NLP model for fine-tuning.
✅ Trained the model using:

BERT (pre-trained on bert-base-uncased).
Training Arguments:
batch_size: 8
epochs: 3
learning_rate: 2e-5
✅ Fine-tuned on the training dataset (training_dataset.json).
✅ Saved the fine-tuned model as:
edu_feedback_bert_model/ folder.
🔥 4. Model Evaluation
✅ Evaluated the model on the test dataset (test_dataset.json).
✅ Calculated:

Classification Metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Regression Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R2 Score
✅ Displayed per-sample predictions with:

Student answer.
Model answer.
Predicted grade and score.
✅ Printed overall evaluation results.

🔥 5. REST API Deployment
✅ Built a Flask REST API:

Deployed the model as a service.
Included /predict endpoint for grading.
✅ Added proper exception handling and error handling.
✅ Added API routes:
/ → Check server status.
/predict → Grade student answers with score, grade, and feedback.
✅ Exported the model as a .pth file and deployed it on Google Cloud Functions.

✅ Verified the endpoint URL:

✅ Successfully deployed at:
https://us-central1-gen-lang-client-0914915233.cloudfunctions.net/edu-feedback-api
✅ Tested the API using:

curl commands in cmd.
Received valid responses with score, grade, and feedback.
🔥 6. Debugging and Fixes
✅ Resolved:

Memory issues by increasing to 2Gi.
Timeout errors by increasing to 540s.
Missing dependencies issues by installing tf-keras, transformers, and pytorch.
Compatibility issues with Keras 3 and TensorFlow by downgrading to compatible versions.
Cloud Functions deployment issues by using --gen2.
Failed API responses by fixing missing fields in the request.
✅ Verified API responses with curl commands.
✅ Added validation and error handling in the API.
🚀 Pending Tasks
✅ 1. Model Refinement and Tuning

🛠️ Further fine-tuning of the BERT model with more samples to improve accuracy.
📈 Hyperparameter optimization (learning rate, batch size, epochs) for better performance.
⚙️ Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
🔍 Cross-validation to validate the model's generalizability.
✅ 2. Testing and Validation

📊 Perform detailed testing with larger datasets.
✅ Improve error handling in the REST API.
🔥 Stress test the API to handle multiple concurrent requests.
✅ 3. Integration with Google Classroom

🔗 Google Classroom API Integration:
Automatically fetch student submissions.
Grade them using your REST API.
Return grades and feedback to Google Classroom.
📌 Display results in your Flutter app.
✅ 4. App Integration

🎯 Use Flutter Dart for the app frontend.
🔥 Integrate the deployed API into the app.
✅ Display:
Student submissions.
Grading results (score, grade, feedback).
🛠️ Add proper exception handling for network issues.
📊 Improve UI/UX for displaying results.
✅ 5. Model Export and Documentation

🔥 Export the trained model as a .pth or .h5 file.
✅ Add detailed documentation on:
Model training process.
Deployment steps.
API usage instructions.
Sample API calls with responses.
🔥 Next Steps
✅ 1. Implement Google Classroom Integration.
✅ 2. Create and test the Flutter app interface with the deployed API.
✅ 3. Optimize the model further with hyperparameter tuning.
✅ 4. Prepare documentation and project reports.
